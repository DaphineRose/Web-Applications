This policy does not abridge or supersede an individual’s rights and remedies under the law.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A.  Sexual Misconduct.</strong>  Sexual misconduct is unwelcome conduct of a sexual or gender-based nature that may adversely and unreasonably interfere with someone’s education or work. It is determined based on the perspective of a reasonable person in the same circumstances as the person experiencing the misconduct. It is a form of discrimination and includes acts of sexual assault or sexual harassment as defined below. Sexual misconduct can occur in person or through e-mail, the Internet, social media, or other technologies. Anyone, regardless of gender, affectional or sexual orientation, actual or perceived, or gender identity and expression, can be the victim of sexual misconduct.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of sexual misconduct may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Rape or nonconsensual sexual intercourse with any penetration.</li>\n\t<li>Unwelcome touching, kissing, hugging, or massaging.</li>\n\t<li>Unwelcome sexual advances, propositions, or requests for sexual favors or contact.</li>\n\t<li>Indecent exposure.</li>\n\t<li>Unwelcome remarks of a sexual nature or demeaning comments about a person’s gender, affectional or sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.</li>\n\t<li>Unwelcome sexual innuendo or demeaning comments of a sexual nature, whether oral, written, or digital.</li>\n\t<li>Insults or threats based on sex, gender, or sexual orientation.</li>\n\t<li>Recording (whether by video, audio, photo, or any other digital medium) another person in a sexual or intimate context without his or her consent.</li>\n\t<li>Sexual exploitation (for example, recording, posting or otherwise sharing the recording of another person in a sexual or intimate context without his or her consent).</li>\n\t<li>Using force or coercion in furtherance of a sexual, romantic, or intimate interest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>B.  Sexual Assault: (Non-consensual intercourse). </strong> Sexual assault is the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of that person.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C.  Sexual Assault: Non-consensual sexual contact. </strong> Nonconsensual sexual contact means the deliberate and unwelcome touching of another person’s intimate parts (sexual organs, genital area, anal area, inner thigh, groin, buttock or breast of a person) without consent for sexual gratification or touching another with one’s own intimate parts, without consent, and for the purpose of sexual gratification.</p>\n\n<p><strong>D.  Consent and Incapacitation.</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>i. Consent. </strong> Consent is the unambiguous, knowing, and voluntary agreement between the participants to engage in specific sexual activity. Consent must be demonstrated through mutually understandable words or actions clearly indicating a willingness to engage in that activity.</p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Past consent between the participants does not imply future consent.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Silence or the absence of resistance does not imply consent.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another.  </li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Consent can be initially given but may be withdrawn at any time.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Consent cannot be given under coercion, force, restraint, or threat.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Children and minors cannot consent in accordance with New Jersey law. N.J.S.A. 2C: 14-2.</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Consent cannot be given when asleep, unconscious, or incapacitated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>ii. Incapacitation.  </strong>Incapacitation is not being able to choose knowingly to participate in a sexual activity. A person who is voluntarily or involuntarily intoxicated or drugged to the point of incapacitation, asleep, unconscious, involuntarily restrained, or otherwise unaware, cannot give consent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>E.  Sexual Harassment.  </strong>Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Hostile environment sexual harassment is based on a person’s actual or perceived gender and is conduct that a reasonable person would consider so offensive, severe, persistent, or pervasive as to interfere with a person’s ability to participate in educational or work activities or programs. Sexual harassment can be verbal, written, graphic, physical or through digital, online, or social media communications. Sexual harassment may occur between persons of any sex/gender and anyone can be sexually harassed. Harassment on the basis of sex may also occur without sexual advances or sexual overtones when conduct is directed at an individual or group because of their sex or gender.</p>\n\n<p>Another form of sexual harassment, quid pro quo (Latin for “this for that”) harassment, occurs when submission to unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature is made, explicitly or implicitly, a condition of a person’s employment, education or participation in a University activity or program or when rejection of such unwelcome conduct is used as the basis for decisions affecting the person’s employment, academic status or participation in a University activity or program.</p>\n\n<p><strong>F.  Dating and Domestic Violence. </strong> Both dating and domestic violence are prohibited forms of misconduct under this policy and do not have to involve sexual interaction. They frequently involve a pattern of abusive behavior within an intimate relationship where one partner uses fear and intimidation to harm or control the other.  </p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>i. Dating Violence </strong>is any act of violence committed against a person who is, or has been, in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature by a person accused of the violation. It can include verbal statements and/or physical actions and can include, but is not limited to, name-calling, hitting, threat of physical harm, and/or damaging property. Under New Jersey criminal law, dating violence is prosecuted as a form of domestic violence.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong><strong>ii. Domestic violence</strong></strong> involves criminal acts that are committed against a current or former spouse, an intimate partner, a person with whom the parties have a child in common, or with whom they live or once lived. Under New Jersey law, domestic violence includes, but is not limited to, criminal acts of homicide, assault, threats, kidnapping, criminal restraint, false imprisonment, sexual assault, criminal sexual contact, lewdness, criminal mischief, burglary, criminal trespass, harassment, and stalking.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong>G.  Stalking. </strong></strong></strong>Stalking is also a prohibited form of misconduct that does not have to involve sexual interaction. Stalking is a course of conduct (or series of acts) directed at a person on at least two or more occasions that would cause a reasonable person to fear for their personal safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress. Stalking can include pursuing/following, unwanted communication, whether directly or through third parties, trespassing, surveillance, or other acts likely to intimidate, annoy, or alarm.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong>H.  Retaliation. </strong></strong></strong>Retaliation is an act of intimidation, harassment, or reprisal against an individual for initiating a good faith complaint or participating in any proceeding under this policy or for otherwise exercising his/her rights under this policy or the law.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong>I.  Preponderance of the Evidence. </strong></strong></strong>Preponderance of the evidence is defined to mean more likely than not. It is the standard of proof applied in determining responsibility under this policy.</p>","scope":"University Policy","approval":"<p>Approved by Mary J.

Depending on the planned arrangements, contracts or leases may have been preceded by a Request for Proposal (RFP) and both may require review and revision by Business Affairs, Procurement, Compliance and General Counsel. Contracts or leases for goods or services totaling over $500,000 must be approved by the University’s Board of Regents. Standard contracts (as defined below) for practicums, affiliations, honorariums, internships and other academic functions that have an expenditure of $10,000 or less may be approved and signed by the Provost. Standard contacts for speakers, performers, entertainers and other special services related to student development activities that have an expenditure of $10,000 or less may be approved and signed by the Vice President for Student Affairs. The Director of Business Affairs, from time to time, may determine that it is appropriate to have a standard contract reviewed more closely and signed as a non-standard contract. Only the President, the Executive Vice President for Administration and the Vice President for Finance and Technology shall have authority to sign: a) non-standard contracts or lease agreements and b) standard agreements with expenditures in excess of $10,000. Contracts and leases shall not be entered into by any other employee on behalf of Seton Hall University and no agreement consummated outside these guidelines herein shall be recognized by the University. Appropriate time frames need to be incorporated into planning processes leading up to contract or lease signing, as discussed herein.</p>\n\n<h5>Types of Agreements and Contracts</h5>\n\n<p>In addition to contracts or leases involving the purchase or supply or goods or services, other examples may involve the maintenance of capital equipment or affiliation with another organization. Contracts or leases can also involve, but are not limited to, the following: licensing arrangements; property leases; research, articulation or exchange agreements involving transfer of credits; contracts involving special services such as immunization clinics; event-related arrangements or agreements with speakers being brought to the University; commitments involving entertainers including individuals, groups of performers and/or musicians, or theater groups; and agreements involving consultants or other “independent contractors”.</p>\n\n<p>In general, all types of contracts or leases mentioned above will hereby be classified into two (2) main types:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Standard</strong> - those entered into by Seton Hall University that will contain standard terms and conditions as developed by the university and previously approved by Legal Counsel, Compliance Office and Business Affairs.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Non-standard</strong> - those entered into that do not contain standard terms and conditions as developed by Seton Hall University. These are typically agreements where the vendor selected presents their own terms and/or agreement to the university for review and approval.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5>Requests for Proposals</h5>\n\n<p>When formulation of a contract or lease is preceded by a Request for Proposal (RFP), a formal bidding process will take place. The need for bidding will be determined by the level of financial commitment in question, and on the outcome of discussions between the requesting department and the Procurement Department. If an RFP is contemplated in connection with a business arrangement that will result in a contract, discussions with Procurement and initial formulation of the RFP needs to begin at least three (3) months prior to the planned effective date of the contract, so as to ensure appropriate time frames for review by the Board of Regents (if required), Procurement, General Counsel and Business Affairs.</p>\n\n<p>Bid policy for the university is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>All acquisitions of goods or services (with or without a contract or lease involved) that total over $10,000 must be transacted with at least two (2) bids being obtained. It is recommended, however, that for orders over $25,000 that a total of between three (3) to five (5) bids be obtained, but two (2) shall be the minimum. Bidding can be waived if the item or service being provided is being provided by a university preferred vendor (i.e. a vendor listed on the Procurement Department's preferred vendor list) or if the vendor is a sole provider of the good or service in question. Additionally, bids involving contracts or leases that total over $250,000 must be approved by the President of the University and bids involving contracts or leases that total over $500,000 must be approved by the Board of Regents.</p>\n\n<h5>Insurance and Indemnification</h5>\n\n<p>The type(s) and levels of insurance coverage required for a given contract or lease will be determined based on discussion between the requesting department and Business Affairs. The Compliance Officer is also available for technical assistance, in determining appropriate terms of insurance and indemnification.</p>\n\n<p>The University intends to transfer certain risk associated with its ownership of property, activities, repair and construction projects. Most non-insurance transfers are accomplished through provisions in contracts designed specifically for risk control transfer. The contract can contain indemnity and hold harmless agreements that can protect the University's interests.</p>\n\n<p>The indemnification provision of a contract or lease outlines the management and transfer of risk, by establishing the circumstances in which parties to the contract will hold each other harmless in the event of a claim or suit that results from the activities or transactions specified in the contract. Typically each party to the contract or lease agrees to hold the other party harmless if it is determined that the issue that triggered the claim or suit was the result of the sole negligence of one or another signatory to the contract. The wording of an indemnification provision will be determined through discussion between the requesting department and Business Affairs, and, in turn, with the Compliance Office and General Counsel.</p>\n\n<p>Each department head is responsible for the proper wording of the contract and its ramifications.</p>\n\n<h5> Specific Steps to be Taken Prior to Contract or Lease Signing</h5>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The first step in initiating a contract or lease is to determine if bids are required. To make that determination, review the bid policy terms mentioned above or contact the Procurement Department for assistance. If a lease is requested, the department and Procurement must additionally work with the Controller to determine if a lease or purchase is the better financial option for the university to entertain. After conducting the bid process (if necessary), a vendor is selected and contracted for product/services using either a non-standard university agreement or a standard university agreement.</li>\n\t<li>If a contract to be entered into is a standard university contract, the agreement should be forwarded to the Office of Business Affairs for review and approval. Any and all “standard contracts” or leases must be completed and attached to a Contract Review Routing Folder (see Attachment B). Since the agreement is of standard format and has been previously approved by General Counsel, a Contract Review Checklist is not necessary. All standard contracts should be signed by the contracting parties prior to final approval and signature by the Provost, Vice President for Student Affairs or other authorized University division head. The Director of Business Affairs, from time to time, may determine that it is appropriate to have a standard agreement reviewed more closely and signed as a non-standard agreement. If the standard agreement provides for expenditures that exceed $10,000, then the Business Affairs Office will direct the agreement to the President, the Executive Vice President for Administration or the Vice President for Finance and Technology for approval and signature.</li>\n\t<li>If a non-standard university agreement is entered into, a discussion concerning the intended business arrangement should take place with the Office of Business Affairs. That office will assist relative to contract language/format, and clarify, if required, the contract review process. <strong>Any and all proposed “non-standard contracts” or leases must be forwarded with a completed </strong><a href=\"/policies/upload/Contract-Review-Checklist.pdf\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=202644|\">Contract Review Checklist</a><strong> (see Attachment A), attached to a Contract Review Routing Folder (see Attachment B) and sent to the Director of Business Affairs</strong>. The Checklist assists contract originator in ensuring that all relevant and necessary contract provisions have been incorporated into the draft document. The Director of Business Affairs will forward all non-standard contracts or leases to the university's Office of General Counsel for review. A concurrent financial review will be carried out by Procurement and the University Controller if necessary. If the contract or lease is for goods or services over $500,000, it must additionally be approved by the university's Board of Regents.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tUpon completion of review, the General Counsel will forward the non-standard contract to the Office of the Vice President for Finance and Technology for signature. Only the President, the Executive Vice President for Administration or the Vice President for Finance and Technology are authorized to enter into and sign non-standard contracts or leases for goods or services.</li>\n\t<li>Original signed contracts or leases and pertaining documents are to be kept on file in Business Affairs. Copies of all signed contracts or leases are to be forwarded to the Office of General Counsel and the University Controller's Office.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5>Time Frames for Steps Pertaining to the Review Process</h5>\n\n<p>Planning for a contract or lease requires adherence to the following time frames:</p>\n\n<p>If it is planned that a Request for Proposal will precede the review process, it should be anticipated that a period of lead time of at least three (3) months prior to the expected contract or lease start date would be appropriate to begin bidding, but contact the Procurement Department for assistance and advice.</p>\n\n<p>The review process for a standard university contract or lease in which standard contract language (as currently approved by the Office of General Counsel) is used does not require Legal, Business Affairs or Compliance review but should commence at least two (2) weeks prior to the anticipated effective date of the contract.</p>\n\n<p>The review process for a non-standard university contract or lease for a new agreement that does require Legal Counsel, Business Affairs or Compliance review needs to commence at least one (1) month prior to the anticipated effective date of the contra</p>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>To ensure timely and appropriate formulation and internal review of contracts and leases entered into by Seton Hall University.

The records retention and disposition schedules applicable to different categories of University records are developed jointly by the user department and the University Records Manager for each division</p>\n\n<h5>Responsible Offices</h5>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Responsible Official</strong>. Each Division Head (Responsible Official) has the responsibility to designate, in writing, a Records Manager in their office or division and ensure that the Records Manager understands and is following the records retention requirements applicable to that particular office. Each University office or division has primary responsibility for the proper care and management of its records.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>A Records Manager</strong> has day-to-day responsibility for ensuring the preservation of relevant records in his/her office or division. These responsibilities include organization of files, implementation of retention and disposition schedules, overseeing storage of inactive records and records disposition at the conclusion of the retention period. The Records Manager is the custodian for the user records, but does not own the records.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>The Office of General Counsel </strong>is responsible for the notifying relevant members of the University community where a litigation hold is being implemented.

Records, particularly financial records, must be easily retrievable for examination by authorized individuals, including auditors. Access to electronic records is subject to University rules regarding information security. Records Managers should work with the Information Technology Department to ensure that electronic records are maintained in a format that preserves accessibility. The Records Manager is responsible for ensuring that active and inactive records are secured in a way to provide appropriate confidentiality and protection from unauthorized access, theft and/or physical damage.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Litigation Holds</strong>. Where the University has actual notice of litigation or of a government investigation or audit, or has reason to believe that such events are likely to occur, it has the obligation to take steps to preserve records that might be implicated in such litigation or investigation. In such an event, the University will take steps to identify all paper and digitally maintained files that may contain records relevant to the case, including e-mails, and will notify members of the University community to preserve such records indefinitely. If an employee or faculty member receives such a preservation notice, it means that the record the University is required to preserve may be in the possession or under the control of that employee or faculty member who has an obligation to preserve such information effective immediately. In the event of a litigation hold, any guidelines calling for the destruction of those records are suspended by virtue of the litigation hold.\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li type=\"i\">Electronic information should be preserved in its original electronic form on the media on which it is stored. Electronic information should not be transferred from the media on which it is stored to a different media for the duration of the litigation hold unless such transfer is necessary to preserve the integrity of the electronic data, and such transfers should only be made after consultation with the Office of General Counsel and the Information Technology Department. In addition, the employee or faculty member that receives the notice should similarly preserve any new information that is generated, which may be relevant to the litigation or investigation by saving it in a segregated file.</li>\n\t\t<li type=\"i\">An employee or faculty member’s failure to preserve records after having received a litigation hold can have extremely serious consequences for the University. Accordingly, a failure to comply with a litigation hold will subject the employee to discipline, up to and including termination, and will be deemed misconduct that will subject a faculty member to discipline in accordance with the Faculty Guide.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Destruction of Records</strong>. The Records Manager is responsible for periodically determining which University records in his/her particular office or division have reached the end of their retention period and should be destroyed in accordance with the Record Retention and Disposition Schedule. The Responsible Officer is required to sign off on the destruction of records and coordinate the destruction of the records with the Director of Archives &amp; Special Collections, or an approved Records Management designate.

Discrimination.  </strong>Discrimination is unwelcome conduct or action based on a person's protected class status that may adversely and unreasonably interfere with someone’s education or work. It is determined based on the perspective of a reasonable person of the same protected class as the person experiencing the discrimination.  Examples of discrimination may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Adverse actions, based on a person’s protected class status, affecting the terms or conditions of the educational program and activity or employment.</li>\n\t<li>Unwelcome remarks, comments or innuendos about a person’s protected class. whether oral, written, or digital.</li>\n\t<li>Insults or threats based on protected class. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>B.  Protected Class.</strong>  A group of people with a common characteristic who are protected by federal, state and local laws from discrimination and harassment based on that characteristic. Protected classes include but are not limited to: age, gender, disability and/or handicap, race, color, religion, national origin, nationality or ancestry, affectional or sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pregnancy, veteran status or military service, marital status, domestic partnership or civil union status, status as a domestic violence victim, arrest status, AIDS and/or HIV status, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, genetic information or membership in any other class protected by state or federal laws, now or in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C. Discriminatory Harassment.</strong> Discriminatory harassment is unwelcome conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his or her membership in a protected class.  Hostile environment discrimination is based on a person’s protected class and is conduct that a reasonable person would consider so offensive, severe, persistent, or pervasive as to interfere with a person’s ability to participate in educational or work activities or programs. Harassment can be verbal, written, graphic, physical or through digital, online, or social media communications.  Discriminatory harassment on the basis of protected class status may also occur when conduct is directed at a group because of their protected class. </p>\n\n<p><strong>D.  Retaliation.</strong>  Retaliation is an act of intimidation, harassment, or reprisal against an individual for initiating a good faith complaint or participating in any proceeding under this policy or for otherwise exercising his/her rights under this policy or the law.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>E.

General Principles</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Appropriate use is always ethical, reflects academic honesty and is exercised fairly with respect to the consumption of shared resources. Users are expected to demonstrate respect for intellectual property, copyright and data ownership, system security mechanisms and individuals' rights to privacy and freedom from intimidation, harassment and annoyance.</li>\n\t<li type=\"\">This policy governs appropriate use of information technology resources and is based on the following:\n\t<ol type=\"a\">\n\t\t<li>Seton Hall University, as owner or operator of University computer and communications systems, has specific proprietary rights of access, regulation of use, resource allocation and management.</li>\n\t\t<li>Authorized users have reasonable expectations of access for legitimate purposes, ownership of intellectual property, including data and ideas, privacy from unauthorized monitoring of electronic files and intrusion and freedom from intimidation, harassment and annoyance.</li>\n\t\t<li>Authorized users have the responsibility to utilize Seton Hall University computer facilities and resources for legitimate University purposes. They must respect the rights of others to privacy and protection of their intellectual property, including data, ideas, and copyrighted material, and freedom from intimidation, harassment and annoyance. As an institution of higher education, Seton Hall University is committed to providing students and faculty with the opportunity to explore the full potential of electronic communication and data gathering to the extent that this use is ethical, consistent with the mission of the University and does not infringe on others' rights of privacy and access to limited resources. Appropriate use of computer facilities for an educational institution extends beyond specific University-related business but can be restricted by the University to protect its mission and the rights of other users.</li>\n\t\t<li>The University will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the privacy and security of individual users is protected. However, no user should expect that his/her University electronic mail or personal electronic mail, if accessed using University equipment, is private. Furthermore, the University cannot guarantee that its computer systems and networks are completely secure. By using University computer systems and networks, each user assumes the risks of invasion of privacy and misappropriation of confidential information or material protected by copyright and other intellectual property rights.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>II. University Rights of Access</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>As owner or operator of University electronic communications systems, Seton Hall University has proprietary rights of access, regulation of use and resource allocation and management. The University may exercise these rights when it deems it appropriate and in the best interests of the University. These rights include, but are not limited to, the following authority.\n\t<ol type=\"a\">\n\t\t<li>To make and retain copies of University data, including e-mail and any other files deemed appropriate, for a time period determined by the University;</li>\n\t\t<li>To access all files maintained on University equipment, including e-mail, for specific authorized purposes, including, but not limited to:\n\t\t<ol type=\"i\">\n\t\t\t<li>To review files for resource management. This may include analysis of corrupt files, potential threats such as viruses or other malware or files that consume an inordinate amount of resources. This review shall be by file characteristics only, such as origination date, frequency of use or some other resource management criterion, not file subject matter. In such a case, University I.T. Services will make a reasonable effort to contact the user before any action is taken.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>To investigate an allegation of violation of law or University policy or in response to a subpoena. In the case of a subpoena or an allegation of violation of law, authorization for such access must be provided by the Office of General Counsel. In the case of an allegation of violation of University policy, authorization for such access must be provided by the Office of General Counsel in consultation with: (1) Human Resources if the allegations involve an employee: (2) the Office of the Provost if the allegations involve a faculty member or (3) Student Affairs if the allegations involve a student.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>To protect legitimate business needs, such as when an employee is unexpectedly absent for an extended time and another employee must assume the absent employee's projects or operational responsibilities. Authorization for such access must be provided by the Office of General Counsel in consultation with Human Resources or the Office of the Provost, as applicable.</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>To remove files from University systems, including but not limited to the following reason:\n\t\t<ol type=\"i\">\n\t\t\t<li>To conserve limited resources in accordance with established procedures. These procedures may be based on origination date, frequency of use, file size or other resource management criteria, including the nature of file content. Authorized resource managers will make their best effort to notify file holders of these procedures before removing such files.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>To purge from University systems illegal files or files that infringe on the rights of other users by inequitably consuming limited resources, abrogating creative property rights or invading privacy (including harassment, intimidation or annoyance).</li>\n\t\t\t<li>To perform other necessary resource management, after making best effort to notify the file holder.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>To limit or otherwise restrict creation or file size of email, Web pages, network storage or other resource allocation to Seton Hall University faculty, students, staff and alumni or other specifically authorized users of University facilities, as system capacity permits. In doing so, the University seeks not to restrict expression of diverse opinions or viewpoints, but to ensure the efficient management of I.T. resources.</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>To manage the University's voice, data and video bandwidth to maintain the integrity and robustness of university-owned equipment, data and services as well as the appropriateness of bandwidth use.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\">These proprietary rights of the University, as applicable, will extend to electronic messages, data or files that are sent or received on a personal, password-protected account on a web-based communication system (such as e-mail, text messaging, and file sharing services) if University equipment is used to access such a personal account, to the extent permitted by law.</li>\n\t<li>The University is not liable for loss of data because of systems failures, emergencies or the unauthorized access, use, or corruption of data by any individuals, including University employees.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>III. User Responsibilities</strong></p>\n\n<p>Authorized users have the responsibility to utilize Seton Hall University computer facilities ethically, with respect for other users and the limited resources made available to them by the University. These include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Being responsible for all activities performed under their user ID and for all use of resources assigned to them. Sharing IDs and passwords is prohibited</li>\n\t<li>Being courteous and considerate in using all University computer resources. Users should be sensitive to the needs of others and use only what a reasonable person would consider a fair share of computing, network, fax, dial-up networking and telephone resources.</li>\n\t<li>Respecting the rights of others to privacy, including freedom from intimidation, harassment and annoyance. Users must abide by University guidelines for the distribution of e-mail and may not persist in corresponding with others if they have been notified to cease.</li>\n\t<li>Respecting the intellectual and creative property of others, including data, ideas and copyrighted material. Use of another person's creative property without proper attribution may be considered plagiarism under University policy and constitutes a violation of copyright or other laws.</li>\n\t<li>Handling confidential information appropriately. Users should always follow best practices in the transmission and storage of University confidential information. Users must appropriately protect any confidential University information they have on their computers. Users should take particular care to protect confidential data when using public computers, laptop computers, external storage devices (such as external hard drives or flash drives), and home computers, and when emailing or posting confidential data to third party file sharing services.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>IV. User Expectations</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Authorized users of Seton Hall University computer and network facilities for legitimate purposes have reasonable expectations of:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<ol type=\"a\">\n\t\t<li>Access to files properly stored under their access privileges and to all Seton Hall University computer files and facilities that are relevant to the legitimate and appropriate use of such University facilities. Denial of access privileges to University computer files and facilities shall be made only in accordance with this and other University policies and procedures. Access privileges, however, are subject to the availability of such files and the University does not warrant or ensure that files will be preserved and uncorrupted due to human error, equipment failure or the need to purge files for resource allocation purposes. All users are responsible for frequently and appropriately backing up all data to guard against such possibilities.</li>\n\t\t<li>Respect for the ownership of intellectual and creative property, including data and ideas, in accordance with the United States Copyright Act and relevant state and federal laws.</li>\n\t\t<li>Limits on the receipt of certain kinds of communications. The University will attempt to strike a balance between the individual user's interest in limiting receipt of certain kinds of communications and the interests of other users in reaching an appropriate audience. However, the University has no control over messages originating from beyond the University community and can exercise only limited control over communications from members of the University community if it is to respect the interests of its members in communicating with each other. To this end, the University will encourage the use of managed organizations (such as those available in the campus portal or the campus learning management systems) for general-purpose communications and the use of approved broadcast facilities when they are of potential interest to large numbers of community members. Individual users are expected not to send information except to recipients they reasonably expect to welcome such communications and are expected to honor requests from recipients not to receive further communications.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\">Users should not expect the privacy of personal electronic mail or other Web based communications, or of content residing on or transmitted through University equipment. The content of electronic messages and files sent or received through personal accounts on Web-based services such as email, text messaging services, file sharing services, or social media sites often leave copies on the equipment used; if University equipment is used to access such private accounts, the University to the extent provided by law reserves the right to access and disclose such content without the consent of the user</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>V. Inappropriate Uses</strong></p>\n\n<p>Examples of inappropriate uses of Seton Hall University computer facilities include, but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Commercial uses not specifically authorized by the University.</li>\n\t<li>Copying any University-owned software for any purposes, unless specifically authorized by the copyright and licensing provisions of the software and approved by the University.</li>\n\t<li>Any circumvention of Seton Hall University computer security, including using another user's password, decoding passwords, misrepresentation in order to obtain access to data or computer systems or otherwise devising unauthorized access.</li>\n\t<li>Activities that damage or disrupt hardware or communications, such as irresponsible or destructive use of equipment, the use of unauthorized network equipment, including the use of wireless equipment that operates above the 900-Megahertz range, virus creation and propagation, wasting system resources and overloading networks with excessive data.</li>\n\t<li>Intentional damage to or altering of systems, software, or information owned by others, including individual and University files, except as specifically allowed by the file holder.</li>\n\t<li>Using computing resources to access any other computer system (on- or off-campus) without authorization.</li>\n\t<li><span><span><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none;\"> </span></span></span>Sending offensive, harassing or threatening messages or repeated sending of unsolicited e-mail after being asked to stop.</li>\n\t<li>Illegal use of downloaded copyrighted materials including text, audio, and video. While peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing utilities (e.g., BitTorrent) are not illegal and are not banned by the University, it is illegal to download or share copyrighted material that has not been approved for such distribution and such downloading of copyrighted material is a violation of this and other University policies.</li>\n\t<li>Disseminating any confidential information unless such dissemination is required by the individual's job at the University and is done securely.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>VI. Consequences of Violation of Policy</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the event that the University believes a student or employee has violated any part of this policy, the University may suspend or terminate the employee’s computer and/or network access. In addition, violation of this policy may subject students or employees to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion from the University or termination from employment.</p>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>Seton Hall University provides access to computer systems and networks it owns or operates to Seton Hall students, faculty, administrators, staff, alumni and approved guests in order to promote legitimate educational, research and administrative efforts in keeping with the University's role as an educational institution.

When 30 days notice is not possible, the employee must give notice as soon as practicable (within 1 or 2 business days of learning of the need for leave except in extraordinary circumstances). Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for delaying the start of FMLA or NJFLA leave.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The employee may obtain the <a href=\"/human-resources/upload/FMLA-Form.pdf\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=152569|\">Employee Leave Request Form</a> from the Department of Human Resources or online from the HR web page. The employee must complete the form and submit to his or her immediate supervisor.</li>\n\t<li>The supervisor signs the form and forwards it to the Department of Human Resources immediately.<br />\n\t </li>\n\t<li>The supervisor completes a <a href=\"/human-resources/upload/Salary-Change-Form.pdf\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=157927|\" onmouseout=\"\" onmouseover=\"\">Salary Change/Payment Authorization Form</a> to place employee on leave. Forward the form for all required signatures.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When submitting a request for leave, the employee must provide sufficient information for the University to determine if the leave might qualify as FMLA or NJFLA leave, and also provide information on the anticipated date when the leave would start as well as the duration of the leave. Calling in “sick” is not sufficient. Sufficient information may include that the employee is unable to perform job functions; that a family member is unable to perform daily activities; that the employee or family member needs hospitalization or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider; or the circumstances supporting the need for military family leave. Employees must also inform the University if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA or NJFLA leave was previously taken or certified. Employees also will be required to provide a certification and periodic recertification supporting the need for leave.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Medical Certification</strong><br />\nIf the employee is requesting leave because of the employee’s own or a covered family member’s serious health condition, the employee and relevant healthcare provider must supply appropriate medical certification. Employees may obtain <a href=\"/human-resources/index.cfm\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=108966,index.cfm,83|\">Medical Certification Forms</a> from the Department of Human Resources or online from the HR web page. When the employee requests leave, the Department of Human Resources will notify the employee of the requirement for medical certification and when it is due (no more than 15 days after the requested leave). If the employee provides at least 30 days notice of medical leave, he or she should also provide the medical certification before leave begins.<br />\n<br />\nFailure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may result in denial of leave until it is provided. The University, at its expense, may require an examination by a second healthcare provider designated by the University, if it reasonably doubts the medical certification initially provided. If the second healthcare provider’s opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, the University, at its expense, may require a third, mutually agreeable, healthcare provider to conduct an examination and provide a final and binding opinion.<br />\n<br />\nThe University may require subsequent medical recertification. Failure to provide requested certification within 15 days, except in extraordinary circumstances, may result in the delay of further leave until it is provided.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Returning to Work at End of Leave</strong><br />\nThe employee must return to work immediately upon conclusion of FMLA or NJFLA leave. If an employee fails to return to work in a timely manner, employment will be terminated on the basis of job abandonment.</p>\n\n<h4>Employer Responsibilities</h4>\n\n<p><strong>University Notice to Employee</strong><br />\nWhen an employee requests a leave, or when the University designates disability or worker’s compensation leave as FMLA, the Department of Human Resources will confirm eligibility for a leave under FMLA and NJFLA. The employee will be given a written notice that includes details on any additional information he or she will be required to provide and the amount of leave that will be counted against his/her 12 week entitlement.<br />\n<br />\nIf the employee is not eligible under FMLA or NJFLA, Human Resources will provide the employee with a written notice indicating the reason for ineligibility. If an employee begins a leave before the Department of Human Resources notifies the employee of a denial of the request, the employee must return to work within 3 calendar days of the date of written notice. An employee has the right to meet with a representative from the Department of Human Resources to discuss the denial of leave.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The 12-Month Period</strong><br />\nFMLA and NJFLA regulations allow employers to use any of four different methods to determine the 12-month period for counting and tracking Leave. The University will track all leaves on a Rolling 12-Month Period basis. This method measures the 12-week leave period backward, from the date an employee last used any FMLA or NJFLA leave.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Greater Prevailing Law</strong><br />\nIn all Family Leaves, the provisions of FMLA or NJFLA will prevail. Whichever law provides the greater benefits to employees will be followed.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Disclaimer</strong><br />\nThis policy does not create a contract of employment or alter the at-will employment relationship between the University and its employees. Nothing contained in this policy shall limit the right of either the University or the employee to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Responsible Office and Executive</strong><br />\nResponsibility for the interpretation and administration of this policy resides solely with the Department of Human Resources.

There are occasions when circumstances require a “reduction in staff,” “position elimination” or “reorganization/restructure of the workforce,” collectively referred to as “layoffs.” These circumstances may arise due to business reasons, such as restructuring or reorganization of a work unit, discontinuation or modification of a program, function, or job(s), material change in duties and/or financial reasons.  <br />\n<br />\nPositions abolished through a reduction in staff may not be reestablished or filled for a period of one year. Positions abolished through position elimination are expected to be eliminated permanently. <br />\n<br />\nA reduction in staff, position elimination and reorganization/restructure are the only types of terminations for which an employee is eligible to receive severance pay. At the University’s discretion, employees may be offered a transfer to a comparable position, provided a vacancy exists for which the individual meets all of the qualifications and is considered a suitable fit. An employee who is offered a transfer, but elects not to accept the transfer, will not be considered laid off and, therefore, not eligible for severance. Severance pay is a cash payment to an employee who is involuntarily separated from the University’s employ and who meets the conditions of eligibility. Detailed information regarding severance eligibility and benefits can be found at <a href=\"/policies/severance-release.cfm\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=203299,severance-release.cfm,254|\">www.shu.edu/policies/severance-release.cfm</a><br />\n<br />\nThe decision to implement a layoff must be non-discriminatory and must comply with the provisions set forth in this policy. Specifically, race, color, religion, age, national or ethnic origin, physical or mental disability, veteran status, marital status, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other category protected by applicable federal or state law may not be considered in identifying an employee for a layoff or in implementing a layoff. <br />\n<br />\nThis policy sets forth criteria and procedures to guide the fair and equitable treatment of all University employees in the event of a layoff. </p>\n\n<p>An employee who has been laid off does not receive preferential consideration for rehiring into another position that becomes available at the University; however, provided he/she possesses the requisite skills, experience and had a satisfactory work history in his/her prior positions with the University, an individual may be considered for reemployment.

If a full-time position is restructured to a part-time position with less than 25 hours in an approved layoff plan, however, the affected employee will be eligible to continue health benefits for a period of time in accordance with the University’s Severance and Release Policy. If an affected employee declines to accept the part-time position, he/she will be laid-off and is eligible for severance benefits under the University’s Layoff Policy. An affected employee may also work in the part-time position for a probationary period of 30 days while remaining eligible for continuation of health benefits and layoff.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Criteria</strong><br />\nThe following criteria apply in making layoff decisions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The first and most important criterion is the operational needs of the University in fulfilling its mission.</li>\n\t<li>Second, is the work history of an employee. Decisions to layoff an employee or to fill a position subject to a Staff Reduction or a Restructured or Reorganized Position should be based on job qualifications skill sets, the competencies for the position, demonstrated ability, performance and/or productivity (including attendance). The candidates’ disciplinary records may also be considered.  </li>\n\t<li>The third and final criterion is the employee’s length of service or seniority. In instances in which no meaningful distinctions between the candidates is apparent, seniority generally should be used as the deciding factor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first and second factors should be given more weight than the third factor. </p>\n\n<p><strong>For union employees, seniority is the only criteria that may be considered in identifying employees for a layoff.  </strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Procedures</strong><br />\nThe provost, executive vice president for administration and the divisional vice presidents (“responsible officers”) are authorized and responsible for identifying employees for layoff.</p>\n\n<p>All anticipated layoffs must be reviewed, in advance, by the associate vice president for Human Resources (“HR”). The review must occur before any proposed layoff is announced or implemented.</p>\n\n<p>In planning for a layoff, the responsible officer must complete three steps: (1) preparing for a layoff, (2) completing and submitting a layoff plan and (3) implementing the layoff plan.

These persons shall immediately report the matter to Division Vice-President and University Counsel or his/her designee. If the Authorized Adult believes that the Program Director may be involved in the allegations of assault or abuse, the Authorized Adult must go directly to the Division Vice-President.<br />\n<br />\nThe individual notified and the Authorized Adult together will call the state of New Jersey at <strong>1-877 NJ ABUSE (1-877-652-2873)</strong> and provide written notification, if required.

General Information, Requirements and Restrictions for All Recipients of Tuition Remission Benefits</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1.  The tuition remission benefit is the cost of tuition only.</p>\n\n<p>2. The cost of textbooks, registration, housing deposit, room and board, tuition deposit for freshmen and transfer students, and any and all other costs, charges and fees, including the doctoral continuation, the mobile computing and the technology fees, are the responsibility of the student and must be paid when due. Any penalties associated with late submission of application forms and any other documents are the responsibility of the student.</p>\n\n<p>3.  Tuition remission does not cover any programs that are designated as fee-based or all-inclusive (programs that cover fees, housing, meals and/or any other charges as part of the overall tuition charge).  </p>\n\n<p>4.  Tuition remission does not cover study abroad courses.</p>\n\n<p>5.  Tuition remission does not cover courses given at other institutions, though they may be listed in the University Catalogue. Only courses offered at, and for which tuition is charged by Seton Hall University are eligible for coverage under the tuition remission benefit.</p>\n\n<p>6.  All applicants for tuition remission benefits must meet all admission requirements and complete all required applications and other registration procedures within the established timeframes.</p>\n\n<p>7.  The tuition remission application process is an online form accessed through PirateNet. Employees select the course(s) to which the tuition remission benefit is to be applied. In addition, employees who have written approval from their supervisors have the option to select “job-related” or not and “lunch hour waiver” or not (see III 10) for their course(s). Employees have until the end of the Add/Drop Period to complete the online application process for themselves, their spouses and/or their dependent children. The Human Resources Department evaluates all requests for courses to be considered “job-related” and will make a final determination in consultation with Finance if a selected course is “job-related” per the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. “Job-related” must be determined prior to the start of the course.  </p>\n\n<p>8.  Tuition remission cannot be approved retroactively for courses taken during previous semesters.  </p>\n\n<p>9.  By accepting the tuition remission benefit, recipients authorize the release of their grades by Enrollment Management to the Associate Vice President (AVP) for Human Resources or designee within thirty (30) days of the close of the academic semester or session.</p>\n\n<p>10.  Tuition remission does not cover the cost of tuition for courses that a student is required, or elects to, repeat.</p>\n\n<p>11.  Students who receive an “incomplete” and who do not complete the coursework within the timeframes established by Enrollment Management will be responsible for paying the tuition for that course prior to registering for the next semester or session.</p>\n\n<p>12.  Tuition remission does not cover the cost of tuition for courses that a student fails or from which a student withdraws after the deadline established by Enrollment Management.</p>\n\n<p>13.  In the event of a grade of D or F or late withdrawal from any course(s), the student shall pay the cost of full tuition for such course(s) to the University. A “hold” will be placed on the student’s account and he/she will not be eligible to register for additional classes until all charges have been paid and the student’s account is current.  </p>\n\n<p>14.  Emergency withdrawals for appropriately documented reasons such as health, family illness or hardship may relieve the student of the obligation to pay for the course(s). Students must submit a written request with supporting documentation for a waiver of tuition to the AVP for Human Resources or designee as soon as the emergency situation is known but no later than immediately following withdrawal from the course(s).</p>\n\n<p>15.  When an employee separates from the University for any reason other than because of total disability, retirement or death, the tuition remission benefit terminates immediately for the employee and his/her spouse and dependents. Tuition must be paid to the University in accordance with guidelines established by Enrollment Management if the former employee, or his/her spouse or dependent wishes to continue attending classes.</p>\n\n<p>16.  When students using tuition remission are granted other sources of funding, the University will apply the tuition remission benefit as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>i.  State and federal regulations will govern the distribution of all awards.</p>\n\n<p>ii.  Should the student be the recipient of a state, federal, or private scholarship or grant, the full amount must be deposited to the student’s account.</p>\n\n<p>iii.  The tuition remission benefit will be applied <em>after</em> all other financial aid that covers tuition only, including state grants, scholarships and other sources of award, have been applied.</p>\n\n<p>iv.  Under <em>no</em> circumstances can the tuition remission benefit be applied towards any expense other than tuition.</p>\n\n<p>v.  When scholarships, discounts or grants funded by Seton Hall University have been awarded for tuition, those monies must be applied to tuition expenses <em>before</em> the tuition remission benefit will be applied.</p>\n\n<p>vi.  In no case will a combination of awards funded by Seton Hall University and the tuition remission benefit result in a refund to the student.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>17.  Tuition remission benefits may be considered taxable income in accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. Employees should obtain advice from a qualified tax advisor as to their reporting and deductibility of educational expenses for themselves, spouses and/or their dependents.</p>\n\n<p>18.  The AVP for Human Resources and the AVP for Enrollment Management, or designee, will review University records for compliance with this policy. Students found to be in violation will have tuition remission benefits suspended for a twelve-month (12) period beginning with the semester following the semester in which the violation was found, and will be responsible for reimbursing the University for any tuition remission for which they were not eligible. </p>\n\n<p>19.  In addition to the general information and requirements outlined above, the recipient of the tuition remission benefit may be subject to other requirements outlined below in this policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h5>III.  Tuition Remission for Employees</h5>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1.  Employees who have satisfied all eligibility requirements may enroll for courses and receive tuition remission for undergraduate or graduate courses on the South Orange campus. For classes taken at Seton Hall University School of Law, employees receive tuition remission equal to fifty (50) percent of the current tuition rate per credit.</p>\n\n<p>2.  Employees may take undergraduate and graduate courses on a matriculated or non- matriculated basis, subject to the University’s policies as outlined in the respective <em>Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogues</em>.</p>\n\n<p>3.  Employees are required to receive a grade of “C” or better in order to receive the tuition remission benefit. When a class is taken on a “pass/fail” basis, the employee must &quot;pass&quot; the course in order to receive the benefit.</p>\n\n<p>4.  Employees seeking only certification credit while enrolled in classes in a degree granting program are permitted to use tuition remission. However, tuition remission will not cover the cost of any Continuing Education classes or other similar such non-degree earning offerings. </p>\n\n<p>5.  Tuition remission may be used to “audit” a course; however, tuition remission will not cover the course should the student also take it for credit. Courses that are taken on an audit basis are included in the total number of credits that may be taken in any one semester or session.</p>\n\n<p>6.  Tuition remission is limited to no more than two classes (maximum of eight (8) credits) during any spring or fall semester. During intersessions and summer sessions, limits are as follows: no class dates may overlap among sessions. Additionally, the total credits for any twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1 and ending on June 30 of the following year may not exceed twenty-one (21) credits.  </p>\n\n<p>7.  Requests for more credits than permitted under this policy must be submitted in writing no later than two (2) weeks before the University’s application deadline to the AVP for Human Resources or designee. The request for additional credits must have the written approval of the employee’s immediate supervisor and division head. Permission for a maximum of three (3) classes in any one semester or session may be granted when:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>i. additional credits are needed to graduate in that particular semester; <em>or</em></p>\n\n<p>ii.  the additional credits are needed to satisfy a graduate program Residency Requirement; <em>or</em></p>\n\n<p>iii.  the courses are not being offered again prior to the individual’s scheduled date of graduation; <em>and</em></p>\n\n<p>iv.  it is determined that the employee’s job performance and the fulfillment of the needs of the department will not be adversely affected by the additional course work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>8.

Procedures for Using Earned Sick Leave</h4>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Foreseeable use of earned sick leave.  Employees may be able to predict or know in advance that they will need to use earned sick leave for such reasons as a scheduled doctor’s visit, a regularly occurring medical treatment or regularly scheduled therapy appointment.  In the event of such foreseeable sick leave, employees are required to provide 7 days advanced notice, or notice as soon as practicable, and include the expected duration of the leave.  Employees should make a reasonable effort to schedule the use of earned sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the department.  A supervisor reserves the right to prohibit the employee from using earned sick leave during certain published blackout periods.  If unforeseeable sick leave is taken during those dates, the supervisor may require reasonable documentation establishing the necessity for the sick leave. </li>\n\t<li>Unforeseeable use of earned sick leave.  Employees are required to (a) notify their supervisors as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of the first hour of the employee’s scheduled workday, or by a time set forth in department guidelines, to advise him/her of their absence and (b) keep the supervisor advised as to the probable date of return to work.  Members of Local 68/68A and Local 153 are required to follow the terms of their respective collective bargaining agreements.  Failure to timely notify a supervisor of an absence may result in disciplinary action unless the employee is prevented from doing so by reason of extreme emergency.</li>\n\t<li>Supervisors may require reasonable documentation when any sick leave of three (3) or more consecutive days is taken.</li>\n\t<li>Supervisors must notify the Department of Human Resources (“Human Resources”) as soon as they know that an employee will be on sick leave for more than seven (7) calendar days so that. Human Resources may communicate with the employee in connection with any applicable leave.</li>\n\t<li>Supervisors must ensure that faculty, administrators, staff, adjunct faculty, graduate assistants and student workers record sick time taken on their monthly or biweekly electronic timesheet.  If the employee has not returned to work when timesheets are required to be submitted, the supervisor shall complete and approve the timesheet in accordance with Human Resources guidelines.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>IV. General</h4>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Any employee who exhausts their accrued earned sick time will not be compensated for any day, or portion of a day, of sick leave taken that exceeds their accrued earned sick leave.</li>\n\t<li>Absences due to occupational illness or injury subject to workers’ compensation may be charged against accrued earned sick leave if the time out of work is not reimbursed by workers’ compensation insurance.</li>\n\t<li>If an employee returns to employment within six (6) months of separation from the University, all previously accrued earned sick leave shall be reinstated and any applicable waiting period will be adjusted based on length of prior employment, in accordance with state law.</li>\n\t<li>Employees who are ill while on a scheduled vacation may, with a supervisor’s approval, charge the time to earned sick leave.

The monetary value of tuition remission received by employees’ spouses and/or dependent children for graduate level course work must be added to the employees’ taxable wages in the calendar year of the last semester of the academic year. The increase in taxable wages also increases the taxes withheld and reduces net pay. The taxes will be withheld from all paychecks from August through December.

Children must be full-time, matriculated students at the importing college or university.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Dependent children of regular, part-time, active employees are eligible to apply for tuition exchange scholarships in accordance with deadlines set by the University each year for acceptance of tuition exchange applications, following the employee's completion of 940 hours of continuous service.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">To be eligible to participate in the Program, eligible employees' children (by birth, marriage or legal adoption) must meet the Federal government's definition of “dependent” as used when applying for financial aid, which includes among other criteria, that a child must be under age 24 and unmarried.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Children must also be dependent upon the eligible employee for support as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). The University reserves the right to request a copy of the Federal income tax return of the employee to verify dependency.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5>Procedures</h5>\n\n<p>Each participating college and university establishes its own policies and procedures for determining eligibility of its own employees' children, criteria for tuition exchange scholarships it will award, number of scholarship awards granted each year and any other requirement for participation in the Program. Satisfying admissions criteria does not make tuition exchange scholarship awards automatic as each institution is obligated to maintain a balance between students sent on the exchange (“exports”) and students received on the exchange (“imports”). One-third of participating colleges and universities make tuition exchange scholarship awards to less than one-half of the qualified applicants. Interested applicants should check the specific requirements of participating colleges and universities. <br />\n<br />\nSeton Hall determines (or “certifies”) whether an employee's dependent(s) is eligible as a tuition exchange scholarship applicant based on the length or longevity of the employee's University employment, as well as the number of imported and exported participating students each academic year.</p>\n\n<h5>General Information and Requirements</h5>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Tuition exchange policies, procedures and scholarship amounts are determined independently by each participating college and university.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Tuition exchange scholarships are competitive and cannot be guaranteed. In order to be considered for a scholarship, a student must meet the eligibility requirements of the exporting college or university and admissions requirements of the importing college or university. </li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">If a dependent child is awarded a tuition exchange scholarship at a participating college or university, Seton Hall will certify, as appropriate, the student's eligibility for tuition exchange by academic year, not to exceed eight (8) semesters or four (4) years. Additional semesters or years are not permissible.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Each eligible employee, regardless of the number of children he or she has, is limited to receiving a maximum of 16 semesters or eight (8) years of tuition exchange scholarships. Each child is limited to receiving a maximum of eight (8) semesters or four (4) years of tuition exchange scholarships. Neither employees themselves nor spouses of employees are eligible to receive tuition exchange scholarships. No other family members, such as nieces or nephews, are eligible to participate in the Program. </li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Tuition Exchange scholarships may only be used for full-time matriculated undergraduate study during the academic year. Summer and winter session courses are excluded.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">If the employment of a member of the faculty, administration or staff terminates, for any reason, while his or her child is attending another college or university on a tuition exchange scholarship, the scholarship will be terminated immediately. The employee is responsible for payment of tuition to the importing college or university in accordance with the tuition policy of the importing college or university.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Faculty, administrators and staff who are participating in the Program are required to pay to Seton Hall, on an annual basis, a participation fee established by the University for each child who receives notice of a tuition exchange scholarship award. The fee is intended to offset the costs incurred by the University in administering the Program and will be charged even if the child does not attend the anticipated importing institution. Payment is due when the employee receives notification of approval from Human Resources. Late payment may jeopardize a child's participation in the Program.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">The associate vice president for Human Resources or her/his designee is responsible for reviewing applications for tuition exchange scholarships, determining eligibility of applicants and, depending upon the availability of scholarships, awarding scholarships on the basis of the employee's length or longevity of employment at Seton Hall.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5>Application Process</h5>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Employees submit a tuition exchange scholarship application to the Department of Human Resources in October of each year in order to be considered for the following academic year. The application deadline will be updated annually. (The University community is notified each year of specific dates for application submission via Broadcast/e-mail communications.)</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Human Resources will verify the employee's date of employment and establish priority for participation in the Program based upon the employee's longevity or length of employment with Seton Hall.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Employees will be notified of the status of their application (approved or denied participation in the program) by e-mail in November. The notification date will be updated annually. (The University community is notified each year of the date by which they will receive communication regarding the status of their application via Broadcast/e-mail communications.)</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Notification of eligibility does not guarantee that a child will receive a tuition exchange scholarship award. The scholarship is still subject to approval by the importing college or university to which the child has applied. The amount of the scholarship award is determined by each importing college or university. The scholarship award by the importing college or university may or may not cover one hundred percent (100%) of the child's tuition expense.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">The Department of Human Resources will send a copy of the Seton Hall Tuition Exchange Certificate of Eligibility to the Tuition Exchange Liaison Officer at the participating college or university selected by the eligible dependent child.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">Employees are notified by the participating college or university to which their eligible, dependent child has applied whether the request for a tuition exchange scholarship has been granted or denied.</li>\n\t<li type=\"i\">It is the responsibility of the Seton Hall faculty, administrator or staff member to notify the Department of Human Resources at the beginning of each academic year (Fall semester) whether the eligible, dependent child has enrolled at the participating college or university that awarded the tuition exchange scholarship.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The University reserves the right to amend this policy at any time. </strong></p>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>Seton Hall University is a member of Tuition Exchange, Inc., a 501(c) 3 non-profit association of colleges and universities that was founded in 1952 for the purpose of making careers in higher education more attractive.

This note is to be faxed to the Department of Human Resources (“HR”) at 973-761-9007.</li>\n\t<li>HR will monitor the appropriate use of accrued sick leave or vacation hours (if sick leave hours have been exhausted) during the (8) day eligibility period and communicate with the employee, if necessary.</li>\n\t<li>The employee is responsible for contacting the Carrier to file a disability claim and for making sure his/her legally licensed healthcare provider (see N.J.S.A. § 43:21-39(d)) submits required and timely documentation to support the claim, including a certification from the healthcare provider as to the employee’s total inability to perform his or her duties of employment. The appropriate forms may be obtained from HR.</li>\n\t<li>Following the initial approval of a claim, the employee’s healthcare provider must provide timely medical updates as requested by the Carrier if disability benefits are to continue. To avoid the claim being terminated by the Carrier, it is imperative that the employee take responsibility for making sure his/her healthcare provider submits required medical documentation to the Carrier on time.  </li>\n\t<li> The employee may be required to submit to an independent medical examination (IME) by a doctor designated by the University or the Carrier. The employee must cooperate with the IME, including providing all requested medical information.  </li>\n\t<li>Throughout the disability leave period the employee is responsible for maintaining regular communication with HR concerning the need to continue on leave. Similarly, the employee is responsible to immediately inform HR if a return-to-work date is provided by his/her healthcare provider. HR will then inform the employee’s supervisor of the return to work date.</li>\n\t<li>Based on the medical information provided by the employee’s healthcare provider the Carrier will determine the length of the disability coverage and when a claim will be terminated.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Pregnancy </h5>\n\n<p>Eligibility for temporary disability benefits and the claim filing procedure are the same for pregnancy as for any other disabling condition. For a normal pregnancy, benefits are usually payable for up to four (4) weeks before the expected delivery date and up to six (6) weeks after the actual delivery date (provided that the employee has not worked during that time). A doctor may certify that the employee is disabled for a longer period if she:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li> experiences specific complications related to pregnancy;</li>\n\t<li>undergoes a Cesarean section; </li>\n\t<li>has another simultaneous disability; or</li>\n\t<li>is physically unable to do her regular job.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A claim for temporary disability benefits because of pregnancy should not be filed before the employee’s doctor advises that the employee is disabled and unable to work.  </p>\n\n<p>The claim should not be filed until the employee has actually stopped working.</p>\n\n<h5>Duration of Benefits/Long Term Disability </h5>\n\n<p>Benefits under this Policy are payable from the eighth (8th) consecutive day of disability and for each day thereafter that the disability continues up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks. The seven (7)-day waiting period becomes compensable when disability benefits have been paid for all or some part of the three (3) weeks following the waiting period.  </p>\n\n<p>If it is anticipated that the disability will continue for more than twenty-six (26) weeks, the employee should contact HR to determine whether s/he may be eligible for benefits under the University’s Long Term Disability Plan.</p>\n\n<h5>Discontinuance/Denial of Benefits</h5>\n\n<p>An employee otherwise eligible for benefits based on a certification from his/her healthcare provider that the employee is unable to perform his/her duties of employment for a given period of time may, nevertheless, have his/her benefits reduced, terminated or denied because of one or more of the following circumstances:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Carrier and the healthcare provider have reached a mutual agreement as to a change in the employee’s period of disability.</li>\n\t<li>As the result of an IME, it has been determined that the employee is no longer disabled, in which case benefits shall not be paid beyond the date of the IME.</li>\n\t<li>The employee refuses to submit to or attend an IME or otherwise fails to cooperate with the IME (such as failing to supply requested medical information), in which case the employee is disqualified from all benefits except those previously paid.</li>\n\t<li>The University or the Carrier has obtained credible factual evidence showing that the covered employee is performing activities that demonstrate that s/he is able to perform the regular duties of her/his employment, in which case benefits shall not be paid beyond the date that such factual evidence is obtained.</li>\n\t<li>Benefits may be denied if:<br />\n\t(1) the employee’s injury was intentionally self-inflicted; <br />\n\t(2) the employee was injured during his/her perpetration of a crime; <br />\n\t(3) the employee becomes disabled after having been suspended or discharged for misconduct; or<br />\n\t(4) the employee becomes disabled during a work stoppage due to a labor dispute.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Return to Work After TDB Leave</h5>\n\n<p>Employees returning to work from leave must have authorization from their healthcare provider to do so. This authorization is to be sent to HR via fax at 973-761-9007.  </p>\n\n<p>When a claim is terminated by the Carrier, the employee is expected to return to work on the next regularly scheduled work day. If the employee cannot return to work on the next regularly scheduled work day, s/he must follow normal call out procedures and supply medical documentation by fax to HR supporting his/her continued absence within two (2) days of the return-to-work date. Failure to return to work, follow normal call out procedures or to provide medical documentation within two (2) days following the return-to-work date will lead to termination of employment, unless the employee is prevented from doing so by reason of extreme emergency.</p>\n\n<h5>Prohibition Against Working Elsewhere During TDB Leave </h5>\n\n<p>Once a TDB claim has been approved, the employee is not permitted to perform any work for remuneration or profit during the period of disability. If the employee is found in violation of this restriction, his/her employment will be terminated, and the employee will not be entitled to benefits for any period during which such work was performed, and all future benefits will be cancelled.</p>\n\n<h5>Appeals</h5>\n\n<p>If the employee disagrees with a determination denying benefits, s/he has the right to appeal to the Division of Temporary Disability Insurance. The appeal must be filed within one (1) year of the date the disability began. </p>\n\n<p>A written appeal should be sent to:</p>\n\n<p>Division of Temporary Disability Insurance <br />\nPrivate Plan Operations <br />\nClaims Review Unit <br />\nPO Box 957 <br />\nTrenton, NJ 08625-0957</p>\n\n<h5>Return to Work With Reasonable Accommodations or in a Modified Duty Temporary Position*</h5>\n\n<p>An employee with a non-work related illness or injury may request to return to work in lieu of the benefits otherwise then available under this Policy under the following circumstances:<br />\n<br />\n(1) The employee can perform the essential functions of his/her job with reasonable accommodations. The employee shall advise HR of the accommodations the employee desires and provide supporting medical documentation. Thereafter, the University and the employee will attempt to reach an agreement regarding reasonable accommodations. <br />\n<br />\n(2) An employee (a) who cannot perform the essential functions of his/her job with or without reasonable accommodations and (b) whose disabilities are temporary may request a modified duty temporary position. The University will determine the duration of any temporary position offered on a case-by-case basis. The University may require that a request for a modified duty temporary position be supported by a certification from the employee’s healthcare provider that the employee is able to perform all of the duties of the temporary position. The University retains complete discretion over whether to offer the employee a modified duty temporary position and when to terminate the position.<br />\n<br />\n<em>*Bargaining unit employees should consult their collective bargaining agreement as it relates to this provision</em>.</p>\n\n<h5>Enforcement of Return to Work </h5>\n\n<p>An employee who is released to return to work either with or without restrictions, must contact HR as soon as the information is known by the employee. HR will inform the employee’s supervisor. If an employee is offered a modified duty temporary position, the employee must be available to begin work on the date the position is established. If the employee does not return to work when required, s/he must follow normal call out procedures and supply medical documentation by fax to HR supporting his/her continued absence within two (2) days of the return-to-work date. Failure to return to work, follow normal call out procedures or to provide medical documentation within two (2) days following the return-to-work date will lead to termination of employment, unless the employee is prevented from doing so by reason of extreme emergency. </p>\n\n<h5>Compensation During Disability Leave</h5>\n\n<p><strong>For All Employees Covered by this Policy:</strong><br />\nThe employee will receive the temporary disability benefit check directly from the Carrier. For a period of disability covered by the Carrier, the amount payable is 66.67% of regular weekly wages up to a maximum as declared annually by the State of New Jersey, Department of Labor and Workforce Development. </p>\n\n<p><strong>For Administrative Employees</strong><br />\nIn accordance with NJ Temporary Disability Law, the University may pay all or part of the difference between the employee’s regular weekly wage and the weekly temporary disability benefit amount with no impact on the claim. The total income received cannot exceed the regular weekly wages.</p>\n\n<p>For qualified Administrators, the University may provide a Salary Continuation benefit that pays up to 100% of the difference between the temporary disability benefit amount and the employee’s base monthly pay, <strong>provided the employee has a sick leave balance of at least 70 hours to use during the first 10 days of the disability period</strong>.

The use of sick hours and vacation hours will be limited to approximately 1/3 of weekly pay. The combined income from sick hours, vacation hours and disability payments cannot exceed regular weekly earnings.</li>\n\t<li> An employee without accrued sick or vacation hours at the start of disability, will receive the disability benefit payment issued by the Carrier only. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Employment Status (Including FMLA &amp; Personal Leave Designation) and Benefits During an Approved TDB Leave</h5>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>To the extent an employee on temporary disability leave has leave available under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the employee is required to exhaust his/her leave under this temporary disability leave Policy as part of FMLA leave and cannot add FMLA leave time to his/her temporary disability leave (see the University’s FMLA Policy). An employee with available FMLA leave will be required to provide documentation required for purposes of FMLA leave in addition to any documentation required for temporary disability leave. The FMLA does not require the University to hold the position of an employee who continues to be disabled after the expiration of FMLA leave.* An employee whose period of temporary disability will exceed his/her FMLA leave must, before FMLA leave is exhausted, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, request from HR a Personal Leave of Absence in order to maintain his/her status as an employee. The University will grant or deny the request based on the individual circumstances of each case. Regardless of whether the request for a Personal Leave of Absence is granted, the employee will continue to receive temporary disability benefits as described in this Policy. The University may require the employee to provide additional medical documentation to support the request for a Personal Leave of Absence, which documentation must include an anticipated return-to-work date. Failure to timely request a Personal Leave of Absence, present requested medical documentation for a Personal Leave of Absence request, or to return to work when the Personal Leave of Absence has expired will result in termination of employment, unless the employee was prevented from doing so by reason of extreme emergency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p id=\"csPasteInner\">*Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements should consult their respective contracts for information regarding employment status during an approved disability leave.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Medical benefits for employees on temporary disability leave will continue during any FMLA leave period and thereafter during any Personal Leave of Absence granted by the University up to a maximum of 26 weeks. Any required employee contribution for medical health coverage or other University benefits will automatically continue during Salary Continuation. Employees not eligible for Salary Continuation will be required to make payment of the employee contribution for medical health coverage and other University benefits no later than the 15th of each coverage month.

Employees are expected to submit written requests (preferably through Kronos) for vacation time as far in advance as possible and as required by the supervisor. Supervisors should make every effort to schedule vacation to accommodate the needs of the employee. </p>\n\n<p>However, the University reserves the right to schedule vacations at specified times due to work schedules or budgetary constraints. Under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for a supervisor to deny a request for vacation.</p>\n\n<p>Vacation must be taken in one-hour increments and must be reported on the electronic timesheet provided on Kronos within the PirateNet portal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Transfer</strong><br />\nAdministrators who transfers to an administrative position in another department retains his/her unused accrued vacation time. An administrator is expected to review vacation accrual with the new supervisor before starting the new position and, as necessary, to make arrangements with the new department to use the accrued time.</p>\n\n<p>Administrators who transfer to faculty positions will not carry over accrued vacation time. Administrators transferring to faculty positions are eligible to receive payment for accrued vacation time to a maximum of 210 hours (or the revised limit, if established by the University) at the time of the transfer.</p>\n\n<p>Faculty who transfer to administrative positions earn vacation time commencing on the date of transfer.</p>\n\n<p>A staff member who transfers to an administrative position will retain his/her unused accrued vacation balance. However, if the balance exceeds 210 hours, he/she may not accrue additional leave until the balance is reduced below the allowable maximum.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Donation of Unused Vacation</strong><br />\nAdministrators may voluntarily donate a portion of their unused accrued vacation time to other Seton Hall University employees under specific circumstances.

Payment is made in one check. Unused accrued vacation may not be used to extend a separation date. Benefits coverage will be based on the last day worked.</p>\n\n<p>In order to be paid for unused accrued vacation time, the employee must complete and approve a final electronic timesheet for the pay period that includes his/her last day of work. No payment for accrued vacation time will be made unless a fully completed electronic timesheet is prepared, approved and submitted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Requirements</strong><br />\nAdministrators are required to submit an electronically completed timesheet each month in accordance with guidelines established by the Payroll Office.

The employee may be required to provide a written doctor’s statement substantiating the illness.</p>\n\n<p>Employees may request the use of vacation time when sick leave is exhausted. Supervisors may request a written doctor’s statement before use of vacation time is authorized.</p>\n\n<p>Accrued vacation time may also be used when an employee is unable to work due to severe weather conditions; to supplement temporary disability or workers’ compensation pay (not to exceed the employee’s regular pay); for bereavement for which leave is not otherwise provided or; to observe religious holidays.</p>\n\n<p>Accrued vacation time may be used prior to the start of an approved unpaid leave (e.g. family, illness and military duty).</p>\n\n<p>There is no provision for payment in lieu of earned vacation except upon separation from employment.</p>\n\n<p>Upon separation from employment, unused accrued vacation will be paid at the employee’s current rate of pay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supervisor Responsibilities</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ensure that employees are aware that vacation leave approvals are subject to meeting department needs and client service.</li>\n\t<li>Advise employees of departmental procedures for requesting vacation time.</li>\n\t<li>Review requests for vacation leave in coordination with department work requirements and approve or deny requests for vacation leave.</li>\n\t<li>In the event that two or more employees request conflicting vacation leave, ensure that the needs of the department prevail.</li>\n\t<li>Approve exceptions to this Policy on the basis of department workload in consultation with Human Resources.</li>\n\t<li>Review requests for leave without pay (when vacation time has been exhausted) in consultation with Human Resources.</li>\n\t<li>Review and approve electronic timesheets in a timely manner confirming that time worked and time used for vacation is accurate.</li>\n\t<li>Monitor vacation accruals to ensure that employees have adequate time available to cover requested time off.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Employee Responsibilities</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Submit written requests for vacation leave (preferably through Kronos) as far in advance as possible and as required by the supervisor.</li>\n\t<li>Complete and approve a timesheet for supervisor's review and approval in accordance with the procedures and deadlines established by the Payroll Office.</li>\n</ul>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>Annual periods of time away from the workplace contribute to the health and well being of all employees.

This ban includes keeping or transporting a firearm or weapon in a vehicle in a parking area, whether public or private. Employees are also prohibited from carrying a firearm or weapon while performing University services off the University’s premises.<br />\n<br />\nDeadly weapons include any kind of firearm, knife, explosive, or other item with the potential to inflict harm.

Depending on the circumstances, Public Safety may need to be notified. The injured employee should obtainfirst aid or other necessary medical treatment as soon as possible. The supervisor must immediately report the incident to HR by calling X-9621 or 973-761-9621, so a claim can be filed with the Carrier.</p>\n\n<p>If a workplace injury or illness occurs outside the normal working hours of 8:45 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. or on a weekend or holiday, Public Safety should be notified immediately. A voice mail message should be left for HR on the phone at X-9621 or 973-761-9621 with details of the incident and a contact number, or the incident should be reported on the next work day to HR.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For critically serious injuries, employees (or their co-workers or supervisors) should call 9-1-1 and Public Safety at X-9300.

Box 1900</strong><br />\n<strong>Morristown, NJ 07962</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the emergency room visit, immediately report the incident to HR at X-9621 or 973-761-9621, if it has not already been reported.</p>\n\n<p>Employees on leave for an approved WC claim should contact HR at 973-761-9621 immediately after a visit to the physician, to update HR about their health status and provide information about their expected return to work date.  </p>\n\n<h5>Workers Compensation Benefits </h5>\n\n<p>Under the New Jersey Workers Compensation program, employees are compensated for absences due to work-related injuries/illnesses after the time lost from the workplace is more than seven (7) days (including weekends and holidays). The seven (7) days need not be consecutive; intermittent time can be counted towards fulfilling the requirement.</p>\n\n<p>An eligible employee who has satisfied the seven (7) day waiting period and who receives medical care approved by the Carrier is eligible for a benefit amount of seventy percent (70%) of his/her gross weekly wages for lost time up to a maximum rate established by the New Jersey Commissioner of Labor. In appropriate cases, permanent partial benefits, permanent total benefits and death benefits may be awarded.</p>\n\n<p>Employees must keep HR informed of any change in health, return-to-work status and/or treatment plan to ensure proper compensation continuation.  </p>\n\n<h5>Disputes</h5>\n\n<p>If a dispute arises between the employee and the Carrier over the availability, type or amount of benefits, the employee should file a formal Claim Petition or an Application for an Informal Hearing with the New Jersey Division of Workers Compensation (DWC), the agency responsible for resolving such disputes. More information can be found at the DWC’s website at http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/wc/workers/workers_index.html.  </p>\n\n<h5>The FMLA/Personal Leaves of Absence</h5>\n\n<p>To the extent an employee on WC leave has leave available under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) (see the University’s FMLA Policy), the employee’s FMLA leave will run concurrently with his/her WC leave and the employee cannot add FMLA leave time to his/her WC leave. An employee with available FMLA leave will be required to provide any documentation required for purposes of FMLA leave in addition to any documentation required for WC leave. The FMLA does not require the University to hold open the position of an employee who continues to be disabled after the expiration of FMLA leave.</p>\n\n<p>An employee whose period of WC leave will exceed his/her FMLA leave must, before FMLA leave is exhausted, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, request from HR a Personal Leave of Absence in order to maintain his/her status as an employee. The University will grant or deny the request based on the individual circumstances of each case. The University may require the employee to provide additional medical documentation to support the request for a Personal Leave of Absence, which documentation must include an anticipated return-to-work date. Failure to timely present requested medical documentation for a Personal Leave of Absence request or to return to work when the Personal Leave of Absence has expired will result in termination of employment, unless the employee was prevented from doing so by reason of extreme emergency.</p>\n\n<h5>Return to Work </h5>\n\n<p>When the authorized treating physician certifies that maximum medical recovery has been reached in the treatment of a work-related injury or illness – meaning no further medical improvement can be expected, then at that time no further WC benefits (including medical treatment) will be paid, and the employee, if medically cleared to return to work, must report back to work on the next workday. Failure to report to work on the next workday after being medically cleared to return may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>\n\n<p>Employees must report to HR on the first day of their return to work with a note from the doctor attesting to full clearance to return to work without restrictions.</p>\n\n<h5>Return to Work with Accommodations or in a Modified Duty Temporary Position</h5>\n\n<p>An employee who is absent from work because of a work-related injury or illness whose ability to perform his/her job is in some way limited because of the injury or illness may return to work under the following circumstances:</p>\n\n<p>(1) The employee can perform the essential functions of his/her job with reasonable accommodations. The employee shall advise HR of the accommodations the employee requires and provide supporting medical documentation as requested by the University. Thereafter, the University will attempt to reach an agreement with the employee as to which, if any, accommodations are appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>(2) An employee (a) who cannot perform the essential functions of his/her job with or without accommodations <strong>and</strong> (b) whose disabilities are temporary, may request a modified duty temporary position. The University will determine the duration of any temporary position offered on a case-by-case basis. The University may require that a request for a modified duty temporary position be supported by a certification from the employee’s healthcare provider that the employee is able to perform all of the duties of the temporary position. The University retains complete discretion over whether to offer the employee a modified duty temporary position and when to terminate the position.</p>\n\n<h5>Enforcement</h5>\n\n<p>An employee released to return to work either with or without restrictions, must contact HR as soon as the information becomes known. HR will inform his/her supervisor. If an employee is offered a modified duty assignment, the employee must be available to begin work on the date the position is established. An employee who does not return to work on his return to work date or who fails to follow normal callout procedures with a valid reason for not doing so will be terminated.</p>\n\n<h5>Prohibited Conduct</h5>\n\n<p>An employee who, in connection with a claim for WC benefits, makes a false or misleading statement, representation or submission concerning any fact that is material to that claim for the purpose of wrongfully obtaining the benefits, will be subject to immediate termination of employment in addition to all other remedies available to the University and the Carrier under the WC statutes.</p>\n\n<p>It is unlawful for an employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an employee as to his/her employment because the employee has claimed or attempted to claim WC benefits or because the employee has testified or is about to testify in a WC proceeding.  </p>\n\n<h5>Exclusions</h5>\n\n<p>Senior Visiting and Visiting Fellows, as well as Visiting Professors are employees of their home institution and are not Seton Hall University employees for purposes of this Policy, and, therefore, are ineligible for WC benefits from the University. These individuals must apply to their home institution or university for those benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, volunteers and independent contractors are not Seton Hall University employees for purposes of this Policy, and, therefore, are ineligible for WC benefits from the University.</p>\n\n<p>Employees who sustain an injury while on jury duty are ineligible for WC benefits from the University. They may, however, be entitled to benefits under the University’s Temporary Disability Benefits Policy.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"csPasteInner\">Disclaimer</h5>\n\n<p id=\"csPasteInner\">This Policy does not create a contract of employment or alter the at-will employment relationship between the University and its employees.

In proceedings in which both the University and an eligible person are parties, the University shall have discretion to determine if an actual, apparent or potential conflict of interest exists between the University and the person so that separate representation for the person is appropriate. If the University, in its discretion, determines that joint representation of the University and the person is inappropriate, the person shall select outside counsel satisfactory to the Office of General Counsel. <br />\n<br />\nIn such instance, the Office of General Counsel may impose additional conditions, such as provision of periodic status reports, and/or require that information be provided that will enable the University to monitor the cost and quality of the representation and compliance with applicable insurance requirements.<br />\n<br />\n5.

These accounts include (but are not limited to):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>PirateNet: PirateNet is the entirety of the IT services provided to the community and does not refer to a specific service or application.  As the campus portal, it provides &quot;single sign-on&quot; access to these IT services.</li>\n\t<li>Microsoft Active Directory (AD): AD is the University's standard authentication system for most IT systems. AD is used to access most other systems, including the campus network, PirateNet, email, the Blackboard Learning System, Banner Self Service and many of the network printers around campus.</li>\n\t<li>Microsoft Office 365: All members of the University community receive an Office 365 account that provides access to all non-email services, including Microsoft OneDrive for Business, providing online file storage, Microsoft Skype for Business Web conferencing, Microsoft Sites Web hosting, Web-based versions of the Microsoft Office suite, and other services.</li>\n\t<li>Email: Students, faculty and employees are provided a Microsoft Office 365 mailbox. </li>\n\t<li>Blackboard Learn: Blackboard Learn is a Web-based course management system used by many faculty for their classes. Instructors and students are automatically enrolled in each Blackboard course for which they are assigned or registered.</li>\n\t<li>Banner Self Service: Banner is the University's system to maintain student, HR and financial records.</li>\n\t<li>All Students are given access to Banner Self Service for Students. This provides access to a student's own record, including their unofficial transcript, bursar bill and financial aid awards, and provides the ability to register for courses and the like.</li>\n\t<li>All employees are given access to Banner Self Service for Employees. This provides access to an employee's own record, including their pay stub and leave balances, as well as the ability to manage their insurance plans.</li>\n\t<li>All instructors are given access to Banner Self Service for Faculty. This provides access to course rosters and provides the ability to post grades for students in their assigned courses. All full-time faculty are given access to Banner Self Service for Advisors. This gives advisors access to students' academic records.</li>\n\t<li>Okta: This system enables members of the University community to change their password and set up password self-service reset by identifying a series of questions and answers that are unique to each user.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These accounts are generated automatically when a new student, faculty or employee record is created in the Banner Student or Banner HR systems.</p>\n\n<p>While most user accounts are generated within a few minutes of the student or employee record being created in Banner, the account generation process may take up to forty eight (48) hours if the automated systems detect a conflict between systems that require manual intervention. Examples that require manual intervention include (but are not limited to): cases where a new employee is a current or former student, cases where a new student is a former employee, or a student or employee has changed their name since they last attended the University.</p>\n\n<h4>Disabling Automatically Generated Accounts</h4>\n\n<p>Access to these systems requires an active Microsoft Active Directory (AD) account. AD accounts are synchronized with Banner according to the following schedule:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Employee and faculty's AD accounts are disabled as soon as their active assignment in Banner HR ends.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that there can be a delay of up to a month between an employee's last day of work and when their active assignment in Banner HR ends. Supervisors who wish to have account access disabled on the employee's last day of work should make appropriate arrangements with Human Resources as part of the employee's separation.</p>\n\n<p>Employees who are leaving employment by the University but are continuing as students should contact the Technology Help Desk to request that the University change their primary role in Banner from Employee to Student. Student and adjunct faculty AD accounts are disabled approximately 180 days after the end of their last class. This practice recognizes that students and adjunct faculty sometimes do not take or teach classes one semester but continue to be active members of the University community.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>When a student or faculty is leaving the University and the University has a business need to disable the account immediately, appropriate arrangements should be made through Student Services (in the case of students) or Academic Affairs (in the case of faculty). </li>\n\t<li>Graduating students are provided the opportunity to have a Seton Hall University Alumni account. Alumni accounts are provisioned by University Advancement. Graduating students will receive email in their SHU email account describing the services available and the process for moving their SHU student email account to their SHU alumni email account. Graduating students will have their automatically generated accounts disabled approximately 150 days after graduation. This practice gives graduating students time to transition to their alumni account.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Contractors and Consultants</h4>\n\n<p>A request for temporary accounts for contractors and consultants should be initiated by the contractor or consultant's sponsor using the contractors and consultants account request form in PirateNet. Upon receipt of the form the University Card Office will create a Banner General Person record, which in turn will generate the appropriate AD, Email, and PirateNet accounts. The request form must specify an end date for the assignment. Assignments can last up to one year. Longer term contractors or consultants must have their account access re-confirmed annually by the sponsor. The consultant or contractor's AD account will be automatically disabled at the end date of his or her assignment. Sponsors should request that the Card Office end the assignment in Banner in cases where the work is terminated prior to the end date specified when the account was created.</p>\n\n<h4>Banner Access</h4>\n\n<p>Access to Banner INB (Internet Native Banner), Banner Self Service for Finance and the Banner reporting systems (Cognos, the Banner Operational Data Store [ODS] and the Banner Enterprise Data Warehouse [EDW]) is not generated automatically, but rather, must be requested by the employee's immediate supervisor using the online Banner Access Request form found in PirateNet. The request must specify the particular Banner areas, forms and reports the employee needs to perform their job function and what type of access (e.g., read only, data entry only, full access, etc.) is requested. The request must be approved by the relevant Banner Data Steward(s) in Enrollment Services, Finance, HR and/or Student Services before access is granted. If a supervisor has any questions about what Banner forms or reports are available and what type of access is required for their employee they should consult with the Banner Data Steward(s) in Enrollment Services, Finance, HR and/or Student Services.</p>\n\n<p>Access to Banner INB, Banner Self Service for Finance and Banner reports requires authentication through Active Directory (AD), so Banner INB and Banner report access is disabled as described above when an employee leaves the University. If a supervisor wishes to disable an employee's Banner access as soon as they separate from the University the supervisor should make that arrangement with Human Resources at the time of the employee's separation.</p>\n\n<p>When an employee moves within the University, their Banner access will not be automatically disabled, but their Banner access may not be appropriate for their new job. The employee's new supervisor should review the employee's access to Banner and Banner reports and update their access using the online Banner Access Request form found in PirateNet.</p>\n\n<h4>Supervisor Responsibilities</h4>\n\n<p>For employees, maintaining appropriate access to the University's systems requires a certain amount of diligence on the part of the employee's supervisor. For the convenience of the University's community, the responsibilities of the hiring manager in the University's account maintenance process are outlined here:</p>\n\n<h4>Onboarding</h4>\n\n<p>For accounts generated automatically by Banner, the hiring manager should make sure that the appropriate hiring paperwork is received by HR and the Banner HR record is created at least two business days before the new employee starts work.</p>\n\n<p>Please alert the Technology Help Desk if the new employee is not listed in the email Global Address Book after the Banner HR record is created; this might indicate there is a problem with the new employee's Banner record that needs to be fixed by either HR or IT. If the new employee is a former employee or student, the accounts may need to be generated manually; if you know a new employee is a former student or employee, please contact the Technology Help Desk so we can watch for the account generation process and take appropriate steps to ensure the accounts get created.</p>\n\n<p>If the new employee requires Banner INB, Banner Finance Self Service or Cognos access, complete the appropriate request form in the SHU Portal. Please allow the data stewards and IT several days to process your request.</p>\n\n<p>If the new employee is coming from another area of the University and has Banner INB, Banner Finance Self Service and/or Banner Cognos access, please review their access to ensure it is appropriate to their new job function and update their access as needed using the Banner access request form in PirateNet.</p>\n\n<h4>Separation</h4>\n\n<p>Be aware that it may take as long as a month for Banner to automatically disable a former employee's accounts. If you have an employee separating from the University and you would like their accounts disabled as part of the separation process, please work with HR to have that done as part of the separation process.</p>\n\n<h4>For Additional Information</h4>\n\n<p>Members of the University community who are having a problem with or who need additional information about the University's account generation process, should call the Technology Service Desk. If the Technology Service Desk is not able to answer your question they will initiate a service request to get you the information you need.</p>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>User accounts that provide access to various IT resources are created and maintained by the Department of Information Technology to support the academic and administrative work of members of the University community.

It is prohibited from engaging in any activity from which officers or employees would benefit financially or personally as a result of their positions at the University.</p>\n\n<p>Officers and employees are expected to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in the performance of their duties and must not exert their positions or knowledge gained on the job to inappropriately influence decisions for their personal advantage or to benefit their family or friends. Favorable social and business relationships between the University and external segments of the community are important.  Officers and employees, however, should not accept meals, entertainment, gifts, or other favors from persons or entities with whom the University has business dealings under circumstances, which give the appearance that the donor intended to influence the officers’ or employees’ judgment or conduct.</p>\n\n<p>The University recognizes the importance of maintaining a reputation for integrity that includes compliance with laws and regulations and fulfillment of its contractual obligations.  Officers and employees are required to conduct University business with the utmost honesty, accuracy and fairness.</p>\n\n<p>Officers and employees owe their allegiance to the University and the furtherance of its mission.

These other commitments should be evaluated so as not to compete with the interests of the University or adversely affect the mission of the University.</p>\n\n<p><strong>II. Definitions</strong><br />\nThe following definitions are used in this policy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong> is a situation in which officers or employees of the University, their family members, or friends have existing or potential financial, personal, familial, or business interests that impair or might appear to impair the independence and objectivity of judgment of the officers and employees in the discharge of their responsibilities to the University.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Conflict of Commitment</strong> is external activities or employment that substantially interferes with officers’ or employees’ employment responsibilities to the University. A conflict of commitment will be apparent in the failure of officers or employees to discharge fully the role or duties expected of them based upon other external commitments.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Employees</strong> are individuals who perform part-time or full-time work for which they receive remuneration from the University.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Officers</strong> are members of the Executive Cabinet of the University appointed by the President and approved by the Board of Regents.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Business relationship or interest</strong> is one in which officers or employees, their family member or friend, serve as an officer, director, employee, partner, trustee,  or stockholder of an organization that does substantial business with Seton Hall and derives a substantial benefit or financial interest, directly, indirectly or potentially, from the business transaction.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Family member</strong> is a spouse, parent, sibling, child,  or any other relative, including an uncle, aunt, cousin, nephew, niece,  father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, or half-sister, whether related by blood, marriage or adoption, partner in a civil union, any member of a household or an extended family not otherwise stated above who lives at the same address as the officer or employee.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Friend</strong> is a personal or professional colleague who has an actual or potential opportunity to reap some financial interest or gain from a transaction that is directly or indirectly related to the University and any person with whom the officer or employee has an intimate relationship regardless of any opportunity to reap any financial interest or gain.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Financial interest</strong> means any interest that yields, directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit (other than duly authorized salary, compensation or reimbursement for services to the corporation) to the officers or employees or persons employing or retaining their services.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\"><strong>Personal interest</strong> means any interest arising from family or marriage relationships, friendships, or from close business associations, whether or not any financial interest is involved.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>III. Responsibilities of University Officers and Employees</strong><br />\nOfficers and employees serve the public trust and have an obligation to fulfill their responsibilities utilizing good faith, diligence, fidelity, and loyalty. All decisions by officers and employees should be made on the basis of a desire to advance the best interests of the University and the public good. The integrity and reputation of Seton Hall must be protected at all times. To this end, officers and employees hereby agree to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Adhere to the University’s By-laws;</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Maintain the highest standards of integrity and demonstrate ethical, moral and professional conduct; and,</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Treat information received by virtue of their employment as confidential or privileged both during and after the completion of their employment with the University.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Officers and employees must refrain at all times from any act, which might appear to be in conflict between self-interest and the University’s interests. Officers and employees must be free from any conflicting interest or influence that would make it difficult to render to the University their best efforts or undivided attention.<br />\n<br />\nProfessional men and women inevitably are involved in the affairs of other institutions and organizations. Effective institutions will include individuals who may have relationships and affiliations that may raise questions about potential conflicts of interests. Although many such potential conflicts may be deemed inconsequential, all officers and employees have the responsibility to ensure that the University is made aware of situations that involve their financial, personal, familial, or business relationships that could constitute a conflict of interest or commitment.<br />\n<br />\nAn actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when officers or employees are in a position to influence a University decision that may result in a financial or personal gain for them, their family member or friend.<br />\n<br />\nPersonal gain may result not only in cases where officers or employees, their family member or friend has significant ownership in a firm or corporation with which the University does business, but also when officers or employees, their family member or friend receives remuneration, kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving the University.<br />\n<br />\nThe mere existence of a relationship with outside firms or corporations does not in and of itself create a violation of this policy. If officers or employees have any influence in transactions involving purchases, contracts or leases, it is imperative that they immediately disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties. Officers and employees are required to disclose the conflict, in writing, as soon as it arises to their supervisor and the Department of Human Resources (“HR”).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>IV. Compliance</strong><br />\nHR shall be responsible for monitoring compliance with this policy concerning all officers and employees.  This policy is posted on the University’s policy website.  On an annual basis, all officers and those employees with hiring and purchasing responsibilities must review the policy and complete and submit the Disclosure Form, which is attached to the policy.<br />\n<br />\nIn those instances where officers and employees are uncertain whether an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, they should inform their supervisor and HR. HR, in consultation with the appropriate individuals, will resolve and document the matter.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>V. Conflicts of interest</strong><br />\nThe term “conflict of interest” cannot be qualitatively defined and is subject to interpretation.  It is recognized that certain situations or issues involving ethical judgment may not always be free from ambiguity.  Therefore, as a general rule, a person should not only consider the actual existence of a conflict of interest, but also the existence of an unknown third party who might have occasion to judge or interpret the transaction. In order to ensure appropriate conduct by all officers and employees of the University, the highest standards of honorable and ethical conduct must be observed at all times in dealings with or on behalf of the University.  Officers or employees shall be considered to have a conflict of interest if:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li type=\"A\">There exists or potentially exists financial or other interests that impair such officers’ or employees’ independent and unbiased judgments in the discharge of their responsibilities to the University.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Any organization in which University officers or employees, their family member, or friend is also an officer, director, employee, member, partner, trustee, or stockholder (of more than one percent [1%] of the voting stock or controlling interest) has existing or potentially existing financial or other dealings with the University,  which might impair or might reasonably appear to impair the officers’ or employees’ independent, unbiased judgment in the discharge of their  responsibilities to the University.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Any University resources (including University personnel, funds, facilities, time, reputation,  or other assets) are diverted or appear to be  diverted from their intended purpose, by virtue of officers’ or employees’ outside activities, associations or appointments.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Officers or employees, their family members or friends acquires or holds investments in real estate or properties in which the University may have an interest or when such officers or employees, their family members or friends  accept gifts, gratuities, or favors from any person or organization doing business with or seeking to do business with the University if, under the circumstances, it could reasonable be inferred  that the officers’  or employees’  independent, unbiased judgment in discharging their  obligations to the University would  be influenced.</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Officers and employees supervise, directly or indirectly, any family member or friend, or make any business, personnel or compensation determination involving a family member or friend. This prohibition extends to officers or employees who are in a direct or indirect supervisory relationship in the chain of command or chart of organization.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>VI. General guidelines for the avoidance of conflicts</strong><br />\nAll officers and employees of the University are charged with fidelity in the performance of their duties and functions and should conduct themselves in such regard solely for the purpose, benefit, and interest of the University.<br />\n<br />\nAll officers and employees should be aware that their positions within the University should not be used to gain favorable treatment or self-enhancement,  unless such occurs as an incidental, secondary result of actions,  the primary purpose of which are intended to benefit the University, its students, and the public in general.<br />\n<br />\nIn supporting and participating in political and legal causes or issues, the use of one's title or association with the University is not considered inappropriate; however, careful judgment should be exercised to preclude any inference that one is using his/her position or speaking on behalf of the University in such instance unless proper authorization to do so has been obtained.<br />\n<br />\nFor ethical as well as legal reasons, individuals should only have direct dealings with vendors of the University in accordance with the University's purchasing policies.<br />\n<br />\nInformation known to be confidential or privileged acquired by an individual in the course of employment at the University should be used only for University purposes.<br />\n<br />\nOfficers and employees should remain cognizant that they are expected to devote their best efforts in furtherance of the University's mission during the course of their employment. Outside employment or personal commitments, if such activities would tend to impair the effective fulfillment of their regular responsibilities to the University are not appropriate and should be avoided.<br />\n<br />\nThe University, as an academic institution, encourages employee participation in various extramural organizations, government programs, or professional associations that are of service to the general public, the University, or the individual's professional or personal development. However, if the nature of the association is such that the University's name may be identified with the outside organization, the individual must exercise caution and sensitivity to avoid any participation or affiliation, which could be detrimental to the University, its mission, or interests. Individuals are expected to seek guidance or advice from HR before making commitments that may be potentially compromising to the University, its mission, or interests.<br />\n<br />\nOfficers or employees may not act for or on behalf of the University, nor vote on any matter under consideration by a committee or constituent part of the University, in connection with a matter in which they have a conflict of interest with the University.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>VII. Disclosure</strong><br />\nOfficers and employees have an affirmative duty to disclose in writing to HR the existence and nature of their financial, personal, familial, or business interest when considering a proposed transaction or arrangement.  Moreover, all officers and those employees with hiring authority or purchasing authority of $10,000 and above are annually required to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Review and understand the terms of this policy;</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Immediately disclose in writing to their supervisor and HR any possible financial, personal, familial, or business relationships that reasonably might give rise to a conflict involving the University;</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Acknowledge by signature that they  will act in accordance with the letter and spirit of this policy; and,</li>\n\t<li type=\"A\">Identify external professional commitments pertaining to outside activities.  Officers and employees have a continuing obligation to disclose to their supervisors and HR any information that may have changed or become known after signing the annual disclosure form.  Such disclosure shall be in writing. Officers and those employees with hiring or purchasing responsibilities  are required to list annually on the disclosure form those relationships that:\n\t<ol start=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type: lower-roman;\">\n\t\t<li type=\"i\">Officers or employees, their family member or friend maintains with organizations that conduct business with the University;</li>\n\t\t<li type=\"ii\">Potentially could be construed to affect their independent, unbiased judgment in light of decision-making authority and responsibility to the University; and</li>\n\t\t<li type=\"iii\">Involvement with outside professional commitments (e.g. service on other boards or professional organizations, associations, etc.).</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any matter involving a conflict of interest shall be immediately disclosed in writing to the supervisor and HR. The University will determine the appropriate response or action.</p>\n\n<p>If officers or employees are uncertain whether to list a particular relationship, they should contact HR.</p>\n\n<p>The disclosure form is signed upon the commencement of employment and annually thereafter for officers and those employees with supervisory or purchasing responsibilities. Any changes in the status or activities of officers or employees must be immediately reported to the supervisor and HR.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>VIII. Non-solicitation clause</strong><br />\nOfficers and employees of the University shall refrain from soliciting and/or accepting any gift, favor, service, compensation, or benefit of any kind from any person or entity that can influence the exercise of their independent judgment. Items of minimal value ($25.00) are not included within this policy and need not be reported, unless they occur repeatedly (on more than two occasions).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>IX. Violations of the policy</strong><br />\nViolations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>X.

Any combustible materials such as paper clippings, wood shavings or textile fibers on the floor are swept clear for a radius of 35 ft. Floors constructed of combustible materials are properly protected by either wetting the surface or covered by fire-resistant shields. Where floors have been wetted down, personnel operating arc welding or cutting equipment shall be protected from possible shock. <br />\n<br />\nc. All combustible materials are relocated at least 35 ft horizontally from the work area. Where relocation is not practical, the combustible materials shall be protected with flame-proof covers or otherwise shielded with metal or fire-resistant shields or tarps. <br />\n<br />\nd. Openings or cracks in walls, floors or ducts within 35 ft of the work area are tightly covered to prevent the passage of sparks to adjacent areas. Where hot work is done near walls, partitions, ceilings or roofs of combustible construction, fire-resistant shields or guards are provided to prevent ignition. <br />\n<br />\ne. If hot work is to be done on a metal wall, partition, ceiling or roof, that precautions are taken to prevent ignition of combustible materials on the other side, due to conduction or radiation, such as relocation or covering the materials. If the combustible materials can not be relocated or protected, a fire watch shall be provided on the opposite side of the wall where the work is being performed. <br />\n<br />\nf. No hot work is attempted on a metal partition, wall ceiling or roof having a covering, nor on walls or partitions of combustible sandwich-type panel construction. <br />\n<br />\ng. Hot work is not undertaken on pipes or other metals that are in contact with combustible walls, partitions, ceilings or roofs, if the work is close enough to cause ignition by conduction. <br />\n<br />\nh. Nearby personnel are suitably protected against heat, sparks, slag, etc. <br />\n<br />\ni. Where hot work is to be done in close proximity to a sprinkler head, that the head is covered by a wet cloth to prevent activation. The cloth must be removed immediately at the conclusion of the hot work. </blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Designation of Fire Watch</strong>—The hot work supervisor is responsible for designating a fire watch. The fire watch shall:</p>\n\n<blockquote>a. Have fire extinguishing equipment readily available and be trained in its use. <br />\n<br />\nb. Know how to activate the building’s fire alarm system, if applicable, or who to notify in the event of a fire. <br />\n<br />\nc. Watch for fires in all exposed areas, and try to extinguish them first only when obviously within the capacity of the equipment available, or otherwise sound the alarm immediately. <br />\n<br />\nd. Monitor the work area for at least 1 hour after completion of the hot work to detect and extinguish any smoldering fires that may be identified. <br />\n<br />\ne. Sign off on the Hot Work Permit in the designated space. <br />\n<br />\nf. Notify the Hot Work Supervisor that the fire watch has been completed. </blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Designation of Final Checkup</strong>—The hot work supervisor is responsible for designating a final checkup. The final checkup shall:</p>\n\n<blockquote>a. Have fire extinguishing equipment readily available and be trained in its use. <br />\n<br />\nb. Know how to activate the building’s fire alarm system, if applicable, or who to notify in the event of a fire. <br />\n<br />\nc. Watch for smoldering fires in all hot work exposed areas, and try to extinguish them first only when obviously within the capacity of the equipment available, or otherwise sound the alarm immediately. <br />\n<br />\nd. Occasionally monitor the work area (at least hourly) for 3 hours after completion of the fire watch to detect and extinguish any smoldering fires that may be identified. \n<p>e. Sign off on the Hot Work Permit in the designated space, and return to Facilities Engineering or Public Safety and Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Notification and Approval</strong>- Once the work area has been properly prepared the department or individual requesting the hot work permit shall complete the hot work permit form (see Appendix A) and contact the hot work supervisor for final review and approval. The hot work supervisor shall:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n\t<li>Review the permit request and verify that all necessary precautions have been properly taken. If necessary, a visual inspection may be conducted prior to final approval.</li>\n\t<li>Call Public Safety &amp; Security to verify that the buildings fire sprinkler system is operational, where applicable. Determine if the work area has any fire alarm detectors that need to be disabled to prevent false alarms, and cover the effected detectors, or request the Associate Director of Safety and Security Systems or his designee to disable only those devices that could be accidentally activated.</li>\n\t<li>Verify the location, start time and duration of the hot work operation. A hot work shall only be valid for the time duration identified. No hot work permit shall exceed an 8-hour period. If additional time is needed, the requester must notify the Hot Work Supervisor for issuance of a new permit.</li>\n\t<li>Once approved, the permit shall be posted at the work area, in plain view for the duration of the job.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Special Precautions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Work Stoppage</strong>— When work is stopped for an extended period of time the equipment must be shut down and secured to prevent accidental sparking. If the work stoppage will exceed the original duration time of the hot work permit, the requester must notify Facilities Engineering to request issuance of a new permit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Confined Spaces</strong>— Any hot work that is to be performed in a confined space shall be conducted in accordance with the University Operating Procedure, FE-23, Confined Space Entry Guideline Program.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Welding or Cutting on Containers</strong>— No cutting, welding, or other hot work is to be performed on any drums, tanks, containers or any vessel that may have contained chemicals or materials that when heated may produce flammable, explosive or toxic atmospheres if the container has not been thoroughly cleaned and prepared.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hot Tapping</strong>— Hot work that must be performed on any utility piping used for the transmission or distribution of flammable gases or liquids shall only be performed by a crew qualified to make hot taps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outside Contractors</strong>— Contractors shall perform all hot work procedures in accordance with this operating procedure or be able to demonstrate that they have a comparable procedure that meets or exceeds the requirements of this operating procedure.</p>\n\n<h4>Personal Protective Equipment </h4>\n\n<p>Personal protective equipment for eyes, face, head, and extremities, respiratory protection and protective shields and barriers, shall be used and maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition. Selection of appropriate devices should be made in accordance with the University Operating Guideline, FE-26, Personal Protective Equipment. Outside contractors are required to provide their own protective equipment and shields, and no University equipment or tools are to be loaned to outside contractors.</p>\n\n<h4>Appendices</h4>\n\n<p>Appendix A — How Work Permit Form is required and must be obtained in person at the Facilities engineering building.

They will identify the purpose for entering the campus and the Facilities Engineering Supervisor who authorized the visit. They will complete the three part Contractor / Vendor ID and Parking Request Form for every employee. This from will include at a minimum the company name, the employees name, the employees cell phone number, the work site, the authorized dates for the visit, the identification of their vehicle, and the estimated days required to complete their work. The vehicle section of the CV&amp;P form shall be filled out for any additional vehicles the contractor brings on campus. The contractor will sign for any access keys issued to them.

There after the vendor will report to Facilities Engineering whenever and new employee will be on campus for a vendor ID card. These cards will be limited to one year from the date of issue before they will have to be re-issued.</p>\n\n<p>Contractors who come on campus for emergencies during off hours will also be required to obtain a temporary ID card. The employee will stop at the guard booth as he enters campus. He will tell the guard who he is, the firm’s name, and the nature of his visit, and the Facilities Engineering supervisor authorizing the visit.

Once established, the corporate name of a facility will normally remain the same notwithstanding future changes in the corporation; provided, however, the President may elect to recommend to the Regents renaming if the University determines that the changes in the corporation have had an adverse effect on the attributes listed in paragraph 5 of this policy.  </li>\n\t<li>Discrete parts of a facility (e.g., auditoriums, classrooms, porches, gates and gardens) may be named separately to recognize:\n\t<ol type=\"a\">\n\t\t<li>A benefactor who wishes to underwrite the cost (or part of the cost) of a defined portion of the facility.</li>\n\t\t<li>A person who has made substantial service or scholarly contributions to the University or to higher education generally.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\tIn these circumstances, a plaque appropriate to the location may be installed within the facility for the purpose of acknowledging the contribution.  </li>\n\t<li>Facilities will normally only be considered for naming in association with a gift to the University or to an affiliated foundation when the present value of the gift is at least 30% of the estimated cost of construction or renovation. The naming of A landmark buildings or facilities with unique architectural or landscape characteristics will generally require a higher percentage. Maintenance endowment funds should be considered as part of the gift for the purpose of these calculations.  </li>\n\t<li>The gift should be made in cash or by means of a legally binding pledge. It should normally be paid within five (5) years of the naming of the facility. A portion of the gift may be in the form of an irrevocable trust or a contractual bequest. The President reserves the right to remove names from facilities when the gift remains unpaid beyond an agreed-upon limit. Should this occur, the President may seek approval from the Board of Regents to name an area of the facility or seek another appropriate naming opportunity that would be appropriate for the value of the gift received. The name will be attached to the facility for no longer than its normal useful life, unless otherwise agreed at the time of the gift by the President and Board of Regents.  </li>\n\t<li>Gifts made through an irrevocable deferred gift technique (including, but not limited to a charitable remainder trust, a pooled income fund, a charitable gift annuity, a deferred pledge agreement [an estate note], or a contract to make a will) will generally not be accepted for the purpose of naming a new University facility for which contributions from private sources are needed to pay construction costs. Such a deferred gift, however, may support the naming of an existing facility if there is no current need of funds for renovating or expanding the structure.  </li>\n\t<li>It is general policy of the University that a facility will be named for a benefactor only if contributions by or on behalf of the benefactor represent 30% of the funds necessary to cover the cost of construction or renovation. After an initial recommendation has been made to the President on the suitable level of support, the President will determine the amount necessary before a recommendation for naming a facility is presented to the Board of Regents or otherwise approved by the University. </li>\n\t<li>A uniform system of external marking of buildings will be established and used on all campus facilities. In instances where an entire building is to be named for a benefactor or others, a plaque may be located inside the structure, e.g., in the lobby or other place in keeping with the nature, aesthetics of the facility. The plaque may give the full name and a brief description of the accomplishments of the person honored. </li>\n\t<li>As indicated in the Introduction to this policy, candidates for all naming opportunities, both individual and corporate, must respect the ideals, goals and Catholic identity of Seton Hall, as expressed in the University’s mission statement and elsewhere.

In short, this means that you may not make unauthorized copies or distribute, display, or perform without permission, any work that is covered by copyright. A work is covered by copyright if the legal requirements for copyright have been met and the copyright term has not expired.  </p>\n\n<p>The requirements for obtaining copyright under current U.S. law are very minimal. <em>A work may be protected by copyright even if it does not contain any notice of copyright</em>. All that is required under current law is that the work displays some minimal degree of creativity and be fixed in a tangible medium of expression. In other words, unless the copyright period has expired, you should assume that a work is protected by copyright.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the limitations of the copyright term, copyright has expired for any work published in the United States before January 1, 1923. For works published after that date, you should assume copyright still subsists. Even for works published before that date, copyright may subsist in a compilation or collection that contains the older work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fair Use</strong><br />\nThe rights of copyright are extensive, but not absolute. One of the more important limitations on copyright is the doctrine of “fair use.” The principles of “fair use” authorize some uses of copyrighted works for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that “fair use” implies a <em>limited</em> use of the copyrighted work. For example, quoting a few lines from a Bruce Springsteen song in a classroom presentation or faculty paper housed in an institutional repository commenting on the meaning of Springsteen’s lyrics may constitute fair use, whereas reproducing an appendix containing all of Springsteen’s lyrics probably would go beyond fair use. Similarly, quoting a paragraph from a scientific journal article in a PowerPoint slide discussing the topic of the article or posting the article on a password-protected course Blackboard site would probably constitute fair use, whereas reproducing the entire article and posting it to a widely available listserv may likely go beyond fair use.</p>\n\n<p>The sharing of music, movie, or other copyrighted media files without permission via peer-to-peer networks or other means is <em>never</em> fair use. In recent years, the music and movie industries have obtained substantial verdicts against individuals who have engaged in the practice of illegal file sharing.</p>\n\n<p>You should also be careful about materials available on the Internet. Merely because something is available on the Internet does <em>not</em> mean that it is in the public domain. In general, you should not download pictures, videos, or other files from the Internet, or copy the contents of publicly available websites, without the express permission of the owner of the material – and in any event you should avoid downloading such files, which may contain viruses and other malware.

Section 107 also sets out four factors to be considered in determining whether or not a particular use is fair: </p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes</li>\n\t<li>The nature of the copyrighted work</li>\n\t<li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</li>\n\t<li>The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The distinction between what is fair use and what is infringement in a particular case will not always be clear or easily defined.

The fixation need not be directly perceptible so long as it may be communicated with the aid of a machine or device. Copyrightable works include the following categories:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Literary works</li>\n\t<li>Musical works, including any accompanying words</li>\n\t<li>Dramatic works, including any accompanying music</li>\n\t<li>Pantomimes and choreographic works</li>\n\t<li>Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works</li>\n\t<li>Motion pictures and other audiovisual works</li>\n\t<li>Sound recordings</li>\n\t<li>Architectural works</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These categories should be viewed broadly. For example, computer programs and most “compilations” may be registered as “literary works”; maps and architectural plans may be registered as “pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.” </p>\n\n<p>This protection is available to both published and unpublished works.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the Rights of a Copyright Owner?</strong><br />\nSection 106 of the 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of copyright the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords</li>\n\t<li>prepare derivative works based upon the work (that is, make changes or modifications to the work) • distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending</li>\n\t<li>perform the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works</li>\n\t<li>display the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work</li>\n\t<li>perform the work publicly (in the case of sound recordings) by means of a digital audio transmission</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, certain authors of works of visual art have the rights of attribution and integrity as described in section 106A of the 1976 Copyright Act.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Not Eligible for Copyright?</strong><br />\nSeveral categories of material are generally not eligible for federal copyright protection. These include among others:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression (for example, choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or improvisational speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded)</li>\n\t<li>Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents</li>\n\t<li>Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a description, explanation, or illustration</li>\n\t<li>Works consisting entirely of information that is common property and containing no original authorship (for example: standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources)</li>\n</ul>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>In our educational environment and as members of the Seton Hall University community, we recognize the value of those rights as expressed in the copyright laws of the United States. </p>","dateLastRevised":"2018-05-23","title":"Copyright Policy","uuid":"85ED33D6-D175-35D6-0A5A080FB4DCCD33"},{"definition":"<p>Guide dog: A dog that is trained to serve as a travel tool for individuals who are blind or have low vision.</p>\n\n<p>Hearing dog: A dog that has been trained to alert deaf persons or those with significant hearing loss, to sounds such as knocks on doors, fire alarms, phone ringing, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Service dog (assistance dog): A dog that has been trained to assist a person with a mobility or health impairment.

Efforts should be made to minimize expenses associated with such travel and to be reasonable in all expenditures. Individuals are expected to exercise discretion and good judgment and the same degree of prudence as if the expenditure were a personal one.</p>\n\n<p>1:1 It is the University policy to reimburse employees only for actual, necessary and reasonable expenses incurred when traveling on University business. Unreasonable or excessive charges, charges of a personal nature (such as movie rentals, sightseeing tours, etc.) and charges not directly related to and necessary for the conduct of University business should not be reported for reimbursement or payment.</p>\n\n<p>Expenditures for travel, overnight accommodations, and car rentals will only be reimbursed after such expense has been incurred and approved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1:2 Grants and contracts: </strong>Travel expenses to be charged to externally sponsored grants or contracts must be in full compliance with the specific terms and restrictions of the grant or contract, as well as this policy. Federal awards must comply with the (e-CFR) Electronic Code of Federal Regulations-Title 2: Grants and Agreements – Part 200-Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards-Subpart E-Cost Principles-<strong>§200.474-Travel Costs</strong>. Federal Regulations must apply to travel for all federal awards and supersede University policy. Primary responsibility for such compliance must be borne by the PI/PD of the grant.</p>\n\n<h4>2:0 Travel Arrangements</h4>\n\n<p>To establish a uniform travel system, the university has chosen to consolidate all travel arrangements with one agency. The university believes this consolidation will provide travelers with superior levels of service, convenience and significant dollar savings.</p>\n\n<p>The agency will book and confirm all requests for airlines, hotels, car rental, etc., in accordance with University policies. While airline costs may be paid in advance, hotels and car rentals must be paid for at the point of service.</p>\n\n<h4>3:0 Air Travel - Domestic: (U.S., Bermuda, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Caribbean islands, and Canada)</h4>\n\n<p>3:1 All air travel should be booked through the University's approved travel agency. Our policy objective is to purchase air travel at the lowest expense level consistent with good business practice. This objective can be accomplished by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Planning air travel as far in advance as possible</li>\n\t<li>Purchasing air travel at least 30 days in advance</li>\n\t<li>Scheduling all travel at least seven days in advance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3:2 Coach class of service will be selected by our agency. You should provide our agency with your destination, arrival and departure requirements. Your requested arrival and departure times should allow the travel service a minimum of two hours of flexibility in which to arrange for the most economical travel.</p>\n\n<p>3:3 In order to place the full responsibility for the most economical air travel with our agency, travelers are not to request a particular airline or specific flight.</p>\n\n<p>3:4 If our agency should come back with an offer of an alternate schedule outside your requirements, you should decide whether your schedule can be adjusted.</p>\n\n<p>3:5 Employees should not request Business or First Class except to meet extraordinary, specific business needs. This decision is to be made by the employee's Division Head.</p>\n\n<p>3:6 In many instances, air travel can be made less expensive by taking connecting flights rather than direct flights. Consideration should be given to the time of day and length of time involved.</p>\n\n<p>3:7 Superiors should limit the number of employees from the University on a single flight, where possible.</p>\n\n<p>3:8 Under no circumstances will an employee be permitted to alter cost-efficient travel plans made by the travel agent in order to maximize Frequent Flyer and other promotional programs offered by the industry achieve these benefits. Such benefits are directly accrued to the University and should be used whenever possible on their next trip.</p>\n\n<p>3:9 Employees must return to the University all cash and other refunds with monetary value received from airlines when they are offered, should they be denied boarding (bumped) from overbooked flights or any other nature.</p>\n\n<p>3:10 Employees are not entitled to reimbursement for the purchase of travel insurance.</p>\n\n<h4>4:0 Air Travel - International</h4>\n\n<p>4:1 Employees should follow Domestic Air Travel policies with the following exceptions:</p>\n\n<p>4:2 Business Class service will be booked for all non-domestic flights which exceed four hours. Exceptions to this policy require the approval of the appropriate Division Head.</p>\n\n<p>4.3 Flights involving international locations as both the departure and the destination cities (e.g., London to Paris) should be booked as coach unless the length of travel exceeds seven (7) flight hours. Exception to this is if the price of the ticket on Business Class originating in the U.S. permits Business Class travel at no additional cost.</p>\n\n<p>4:4 Travelers may be advised by our agency as to areas of the world where travel may be unsafe due to international terrorism, as well as specific carriers that should be avoided. Employees are not permitted to override these advisories.</p>\n\n<p>4:5 Employees who are required to obtain a Passport for international business travel will be reimbursed for both initial and/or renewal fees through completing a Travel and Expense Report.</p>\n\n<h4>5:0 Lodging</h4>\n\n<p>5:1 When University business makes it necessary for an individual to stay away from home overnight or longer, the University will provide reimbursement of reasonable lodging charges.</p>\n\n<p>5:2 A single room with private bath in a business class hotel/motel is the University standard. Use of a deluxe hotel/motel is rarely justified and should be approved by the appropriate Division Head. Suite or luxury accommodations cannot be reimbursed unless prior Division Head approval is received or other rooms are not available.</p>\n\n<p>5:3 All hotel/motel reservations should be made through our travel agency. If this is not possible, the traveling employee has the responsibility of securing reasonable lodging cost, as outlined herein.</p>\n\n<p>5:4 Our travel agent negotiates rates for employees at selected hotels/motels in many major cities. Employees should stay in these hotels whenever possible. Deviations requested by the employee will be permitted in certain circumstances (e.g., when attending special schools, seminars, and meetings with clients).</p>\n\n<p>5:5 Whenever possible, rooms should be reserved in hotels with a corporate rate. To avoid &quot;no-show&quot; billing, guaranteed reservations must be canceled.</p>\n\n<p>5:6 Other guidelines include the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>To take advantage of corporate rates, hotels may require an identification number at the time of check-in. These are provided by our travel agent.</li>\n\t<li>Rates lower than corporate rates may be available in a specific locale or because of special promotions or special conferences/seminars. The employee is responsible for ensuring he/she is not charged more than the quoted rate or that the lowest available rate is offered when checking in.</li>\n\t<li>When canceling a reservation, make a record of the cancellation number or the name of the hotel employee taking the cancellation. This procedure helps resolve &quot;no show&quot; billing disputes. Cancellation of hotel reservations is the responsibility of the employee.</li>\n\t<li>When replacement accommodations are required, our agent will handle both the replacement reservation and the cancellation.</li>\n\t<li>Our travel agent guarantees reservations. If the employee makes the reservation, guaranteeing the reservation is her or his responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>6:0 Transportation at Destination</h4>\n\n<p>6:1 Employees will be reimbursed for transportation costs incurred while away on business.</p>\n\n<p>6:2 Employees are expected to use the most economical transportation services appropriate under the circumstances and are therefore encouraged to use (in order of desirability): 1) courtesy cars, 2) airport limousines or buses whenever possible rather than 3) taxis or 4) rental cars. Sharing of vehicles is encouraged, where possible.</p>\n\n<p>6:3 Many hotels have courtesy cars that will pick up the traveler at an airport and take him back for no charge. Employees are urged to take advantage of this free service whenever possible.</p>\n\n<p>6:4 Airport limousines or buses are the second least expensive mode of transportation from an airport to a hotel and should be used whenever possible. At major airports (New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, etc.) such services are quick as a taxi and decidedly less expensive. This does not include chauffeured limousines, which are much more expensive.</p>\n\n<p>6:5 Where airport limousines or buses are not available, a taxi is often the most economical and convenient mode of transportation available. The use of taxis is preferred over rental cars, but the employee must use judgment. Individual receipts from taxis are often hard to obtain, so explain all such charges on a trip-by-trip basis in the space provided on the expense account form designated &quot;Purpose of Trip.&quot;</p>\n\n<h4>6:6 Rental Cars</h4>\n\n<p>6:6.1 Only if other means of local transportation are unavailable, impractical or uneconomical may an employee use a rental car. In particular, trips that involve travel only to and from a downtown location very seldom require an employee to rent an automobile.</p>\n\n<p>6:6.2 Rental cars should, if possible, be arranged by the University's travel agent to secure the best rate possible.</p>\n\n<p>6:6.3 If a rented car is used, the most economical car adequate for business requirements must be used.</p>\n\n<p>6:6.4 The physical condition of the rental car is to be examined prior to driving it from the car rental lot. Report damaged areas immediately to the car rental agency and document them to avoid possible litigation at a later date for damages to the car for which the University is not responsible.</p>\n\n<p>6:6.5 If an employee rents a car in the U.S. while on University business, that employee need not purchase collision and auto liability insurance offered through the rental company as the University's auto insurance policy covers University rented vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>6:6.6 In countries outside the U.S., employees should take out extra insurance offered by the local rental agency.</p>\n\n<p>6:6.7 Employees should refuel rental cars just prior to return to the vendor whenever possible and practical to avoid any surcharge on fuel. The cost of refueling will be reimbursed on the travel and expense report.</p>\n\n<h4>7.0 Private Vehicles/ Local Transportation</h4>\n\n<p>7:1 Individuals will be reimbursed for mileage of their personal car while on business, at the current IRS mileage allowance. Reimbursement covers all expenses except tolls and parking.</p>\n\n<p>7:2 Reimbursement for the cost of vehicle parking fees and tolls shall be allowed.</p>\n\n<p>7:3 For long distance travel, prior approval must be obtained from proper supervision for permission to use a personal car in lieu of public transportation. These expenses will be reimbursed only to the extent that they do not exceed the cost of economy common carrier (air, train, bus) fare (including any discount fare). A quote of comparable rate must be obtained from our Travel Agency before making this decision.</p>\n\n<p>Appropriate supervisors may give authorization provided:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>such use does not significantly increase travel time.</li>\n\t<li>the employee has a valid driver's license.</li>\n\t<li>the employee has adequate insurance protection.</li>\n\t<li>other means of transportation are unavailable or impractical.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>7:4 University provided cars may be used when assigned while traveling locally on University business. If not, a personal car is expected to be used, with the University reimbursing the employee, as noted above.</p>\n\n<p>7:5 When a rental vehicle is used instead of a personal car for local business, a statement justifying the use of the rental should be attached to the travel and expense report. Such use should be approved in advance.</p>\n\n<p>7.6 Employees will not be reimbursed for any fines (moving or parking) incurred when using rental, University, or personal cars on University business.</p>\n\n<p>7:7 Accident Reporting: Accidents involving rental, University, and personal cars shall be reported immediately consistent with local/state governmental laws to the proper authorities. A report should be made to the Office of Public Safety and Security, with a copy to the University's Safety Coordinator/Risk Agent following guidelines established by the University.</p>\n\n<p>7:8 Traveling to an airport on University business, employees should weigh the cost (mileage reimbursement and parking) of using a personal vehicle versus a taxi or limousine and also reasonably consider convenience. A limousine should be arranged through the University's travel agent. Reimbursement for taxi or limousine fares will be allowed.</p>\n\n<h4>8:0 Meals and Entertainment</h4>\n\n<p>8:1 The University will reimburse employees for individual meal expense when traveling overnight on University business. Employees are expected to make every effort to minimize meal expense. The expense of one's meals should be recorded and reported daily as breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Normally, breakfast is authorized only when the preceding night was spent away from home in a hotel/motel. Dinner is normally authorized only when the traveler will be staying away from home in a hotel/motel that same night.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>8:2 Employee reimbursement for meals where the employee is not traveling overnight on University business can only occur if the meal is for a business related purpose. To be considered business related, the meal must be with at least one business associate, vendor representative, customer or employee and must have a business purpose and benefit. The meal must not be considered lavish or extravagant. Expense reporting must follow specific Internal Revenue Service guidelines (see Expense Reporting and Receipt Requirements).</p>\n\n<h4>9:0 Special Functions/Student Related Entertainment</h4>\n\n<p>9:1 University funds may only be expended for entertainment or social functions that are deemed beneficial to the University, have a business purpose, and have been submitted for approval to the requestor's division head. Division heads will submit their own such requests to the President for his approval. Approval of such requests should be based minimally on the following factors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>funds are available in the requestor's budget</li>\n\t<li>The request for such expenditure of University funds has been made prior to the entertainment. Funding for entertainment that has been properly approved will be reimbursed after the entertainment has been completed. Advance funding will not be provided by the University.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>9:2 Student Related Travel/Entertainment</h4>\n\n<p>9:2.1 Activities involving student travel/entertainment such as athletic/club travel and student group seminars/retreats may receive travel advances.</p>\n\n<p>9:2.2 All requests for student travel, overnight accommodations, meals and other related expenses requiring the expenditure of University funds must have been submitted to the requestor's division head in writing for approval.</p>\n\n<p>9:2.3 See Expense Reporting and Receipt Requirements for the requirements for expense reimbursement.</p>\n\n<h4>10:0 Expense Reporting</h4>\n\n<p>10:1 All employee expense reports must be submitted for approval in accordance with <a href=\"/policies/purchasing-policy-overview.cfm\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=236680,/policies/purchasing-policy-overview.cfm,254|\" onmouseout=\"\" onmouseover=\"\">Purchasing &amp; Procedure Overview Policy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>10:2 The employee and the approving individual are responsible for the preparation of expense reports which reflect reasonableness, completeness as to supporting receipt documentation, business purpose, and proper expenditures, all in accordance with University policy. The approving individual should either amend reports submitted or return them to the employee where improprieties or inaccuracies exist or required supporting documentation is missing. Once approved, the report should be sent to accounts payable.</p>\n\n<p>10:3 The form used to report expenses or request reimbursement should be the Expense Report contained in the Excel spreadsheet. It can be prepared on a computer or manually (typewritten or in ink). It must be manually signed and dated by the employee and the approving individual.</p>\n\n<p>10:4 The Expense Report should reflect at the top the employee's name, Campus ID#, department, Banner Index/Account number and period covered. In the space provided, the expense report should reflect, in accordance with IRS regulations, each separate expense by day of a business trip, such as transportation, lodging, meals, telephone, etc. (detailed lodging receipts should be broken down for reporting purposes); and it should reflect the dates of departure and return, the number of days gone, and the business purpose of the trip.</p>\n\n<p>Entertainment, which includes the cost of reimbursable meals while not away on a business trip(see Meals/Entertainment discussions), should be described on an expense report in the following manner, as dictated by IRS regulations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Nature of each separate expense</li>\n\t<li>Amount of each separate expense</li>\n\t<li>Date</li>\n\t<li>Place/location</li>\n\t<li>Persons entertained and their occupations or other information which shows their business relationship to the employee</li>\n\t<li>Business purpose (business reason or the business benefit gained or expected to be gained from the entertainment).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Private Vehicle/Local Transportation documentation on an expense report should include, in accordance with IRS regulations, the amount of each separate expense, mileage for each business use of a personal car, date of use, name of city or other destination, and the business purpose for the expense or use of the car.</p>\n\n<p>10:5 Expense reports with supporting Receipts (see below) should be submitted on a timely basis, not later than 30 calendar days following returned from a business trip.</p>\n\n<p>10:6 The expense must be approved by the appropriate individual. If necessary, distributions to various departmental accounts and budgets can be provided on the expense report. Documentation must be supplied as to business purpose, names and affiliation of those attending.</p>\n\n<h4>11:0 Receipt Requirements</h4>\n\n<p>11:1 Original receipts required to support expenditures on an expense report should be attached to the expense report prior to submission to one's immediate supervisor. In accordance with IRS regulations, receipts are always required to support lodging expense. These receipts must be itemized lodging bills, not credit card receipts. Receipts for other items are only required where the individual expense item is $75 or more.</p>\n\n<p>If, for any reason, an original receipt is lost and/or unobtainable, the employee should submit a signed statement to that effect.</p>\n\n<p>11:2 <strong>University staff traveling with student groups</strong> (athletic teams, band, debate, etc.) should provide receipts for all expenditures as noted in this policy with this exception: funds given to students on a per diem basis for meals and other expenses should be evidenced by a listing of all students receiving such funds with the receipt evidenced by the student's signature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11:3 FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH IRS REGULATIONS NOTED IN 10:0 (EXPENSE REPORTING) AND 11:0 (RECEIPT REQUIREMENTS) COULD RESULT IN TAXABLE INCOME TO THE EMPLOYEE</strong></p>\n\n<h4>12:0 Disallowed Expenses</h4>\n\n<p>12:1 Personal gifts and/or luncheons/dinners for employees (for instance, as is customary on holidays, Christmas, birthdays, Secretary's Day, etc.) which have no specified business purpose, are not to be charged as an expense to the University. Such items are a personal expense to be paid for by the individual purchasing the gift or providing the luncheon/dinner for the employee.</p>\n\n<p>12:2 Payment for attendance at special events of the University (i.e., sports dinners, Many-Are-One, etc.) is the personal expense of the employee, unless directly related to the conduct of business in accordance with the individual's job responsibility at the university.</p>\n\n<p>12:3 While employees may request reimbursement of other reasonable, actual and necessary expenditures not discussed in &quot;Expense Reporting and Receipt Requirement,&quot; they should not be seeking reimbursement for expenditures which should be handled by University credit card, purchase order or check requisition</p>\n\n<p> </p>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>This is a statement of Seton Hall University policy on business, travel and entertainment expenses.

They will prioritize student breaches as minor, moderate, or major, and recommend actions related to the breach. Prioritization is conducted by a subgroup of the Student Professionalism Subcommittee called the Rapid Response Team (RRT) that is comprised of the five members of the subcommittee appointed by the Dean. Procedures of the SPS are described below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedure for Review for Academic Promotion</strong><br />\nA comprehensive evaluation of each student’s performance will be conducted by the Student Performance Review Committee (SPRC) at the following academic checkpoints to determine the student’s preparedness for the next Phase/component of the curriculum:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Advancement from the end of the first academic year to the second academic year (both within Phase 1)</li>\n\t<li>Advancement from Phase 1 to Phase 2</li>\n\t<li>Prior to beginning Advanced Clinical Rotations</li>\n\t<li>Advancement from Phase 2 to Phase 3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Criteria for advancement will include adherence to the Student Code of Conduct and Statement on Professionalism. Students must also pass all required courses, clerkships, advanced clinical rotations, and high stakes examinations in each curricular Phase/Component to advance to the next Phase/Component.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedure for Academic Remediation</strong><br />\nIf a student fails a course, clerkship or ACR, remediation is required. Remediation cannot occur while a student is actively participating in another course/clerkship.</p>\n\n<p>If a student fails a Phase 1 course and successfully remediates it, the grade on his/her transcript will change from “Fail” to “Pass.”</p>\n\n<p>If a student fails a Phase 2 clerkship, the failing grade and the remediated grade will appear on the student’s transcript. If a student fails only a single clerkship, and the failure was caused solely by a failing shelf examination grade, only the remediated grade will appear on the student’s transcript. If a student fails a clerkship for any reason other than a failing shelf examination grade, or subsequently fails an additional clerkship for any reason, all grades (initial and remediated) will appear on the student’s transcript.</p>\n\n<p>Students have two opportunities to remediate a course, clerkship, or ACR. Failure to remediate a course, clerkship or ACR after two remediation attempts is grounds for dismissal from the SOM.</p>\n\n<p>The Student Performance Review Committee (SPRC) will determine if the student can successfully remediate within their existing curricular schedule, or if the student’s curricular schedule needs to be modified. This determination will be made at a minimum at the following academic checkpoints:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>After conclusion of two fundamentals courses of S/S/R</li>\n\t<li>Advancement from the end of the first academic year to the second academic year (both within Phase 1)</li>\n\t<li>Advancement from Phase 1 to Phase 2</li>\n\t<li>Advancement from Clerkships to Advanced Clinical Rotations</li>\n\t<li>Advancement from Phase 2 to Phase 3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The SPRC does not determine whether a student passes or fails any curricular element; that is determined according to a scoring rubric applied by the relevant faculty member. The SPRC reviews recommendations from the relevant faculty member(s) regarding remediation for students not meeting expectations, and ultimately makes the final remediation and/or action plan.</p>\n\n<p>In Phase 1, if a student fails remediation or fails more than 2 courses (even if the initial failure(s) were successfully remediated), the student will be required to repeat the entire academic year.</p>\n\n<p>The student is provided, in writing, the decision of the SPRC within 10 days of its being convened.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedures for Evaluation and Remediation of Student Professionalism Standards</strong><br />\nAny breach in professional behavior as defined in the School of Medicine's Student Code of Conduct or Standards of Professionalism, may result in disciplinary action against the student. Students are held to the standards of altruism, accountability and responsibility, excellence, duty, honesty and integrity, and respect for others at all times. The following procedural guidelines apply for any faculty member, student or other individual who believes that a student has acted unprofessionally by, for example, cheating on an examination, plagiarizing someone else's work, falsifying data, abdicating ethical responsibility, behaving abusively toward another student, preceptor, faculty/staff member, or patient, or irresponsibly communicating verbally or in writing, including in emails, social networking sites or other web-based forums. The above list is not an exhaustive list, but rather illustrative examples of unprofessional behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Allegations of student breaches in professional behavior can be reported through EthicsPoint or submitted directly to the SPS. The EthicsPoint reporting system is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and can be accessed via phone or internet. EthicsPoint reports related to breaches in student professionalism standards will be forwarded to the Rapid Response Team. The members of the RRT will independently rank the alleged breach as minor, moderate, or major. As described in the Role and Procedures for the Student Professionalism Subcommittee, breaches ranked as minor or moderate will be addressed internally by the RRT; major breaches will be referred to the full Student Professionalism Subcommittee.</p>\n\n<p>The full Student Professionalism Subcommittee will address major and/or repeated moderate breaches in student professionalism, and will provide recommendations for action to the SPRC.</p>\n\n<p>The SPRC reviews information from the SPS, and can speak with the student and other individuals involved as needed. The SPRC will then make a final decision regarding remediation and/or action plan.</p>\n\n<p>The SPRC notifies the student, in writing, of its decision within 10 days of its being convened. Adjudication could result in dismissal of the allegation, a formal reprimand, failure in a course or clinical experience with subsequent required remediation, suspension or expulsion from the School of Medicine. </p>\n\n<p>If remediation is not successful (defined as a repeated allegation of breach in professional behavior), the matter is again brought to the SPS, and may be brought to the SPRC, with the same outcome options as described above. If this second allegation is not dismissed, then noting of the first and the second breach appears in the student's permanent record.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Procedures for Appeal of SPRC Actions</strong><br />\nA student has the right to appeal any decision of the SPRC. All appeals must be submitted to the Dean by the student in writing and within 10 days of receiving the SPRC's decision. The Dean may elect to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>take no action, allowing the SPRC's report and penalty imposed to stand;</li>\n\t<li>refer the appeal to the SPRC for reconsideration;</li>\n\t<li>modify the penalties and/or decisions of the SPRC; or</li>\n\t<li>empanel an ad hoc appeals committee of three to five faculty members of the School Medicine who have no role in the assessment of the performance of the student to examine the issue and/or decision, and advise the Dean on possible action.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If the Dean elects to empanel an ad hoc appeals committee, the student must submit to the committee a written statement delineating an argument supporting his or her appeal. The ad hoc appeals committee shall have the authority to investigate the matter fully and to request material from the student, the faculty/staff member involved, and the SPRC. In all cases, the ad hoc appeals committee's recommendation will be given to the Dean, who will make the final decision of action. The Dean's decision in all such matters is final.</p>\n\n<p>At any time that a student appears in front of the SPRC, the student may have an adviser of his or her choice from within the faculty of the School of Medicine present, but that adviser may not address the committee.</p>\n\n<h4>Related Links</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"/student-life/student-conduct.cfm\" id=\"CP___PAGEID=195502,student-conduct.cfm,251|\">Student Code of Conduct</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://lcme.org/publications/\" id=\"http://lcme.org/publications/|\">Element 9.9 of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accreditation standards</a></li>\n</ul>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<ul>\n\t<li>To describe the role, policies, and procedures of the Student Performance Review Committee (SPRC) as related to student advancement and adjudication related to student achievement of performance criteria including student breaches in professionalism standards</li>\n\t<li>To describe the appeals policy and procedures for students related to decisions of the Student Performance Review Committee (SPRC)</li>\n</ul>","dateLastRevised":"2018-08-07","title":"Role and Procedures of the Student Performance Review Committee","uuid":"CFA0BD11-C8E0-8F06-86A4D2DC33AD1DA4"},{"definition":"<p>The relationship between a student and a faculty member who is evaluating or assessing that student is one that creates a power dynamic, and one that can be at risk for conflicting interests.

As a Catholic institution of higher education, the University embraces Judeo-Christian values that proclaim the dignity and rights of all people. The University is committed to maintaining a fair and professional working, learning and living environment in which students, faculty, administrators and staff carry out their responsibilities in an atmosphere free of conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>B. The University considers it inappropriate for any member of the University community to establish an intimate relationship with a student, subordinate, or colleague on whose academic or work performance he or she will be required to make professional judgments. The University requires that the individual cease such conduct and/or divest himself/herself of the professional responsibility for supervision or oversight, should an intimate relationship develop. In addition, the individual with the supervisory or educational responsibility for an employee, faculty member or student must inform his or her immediate supervisor of the relationship so that the University may take appropriate action, if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>C. Intimate relationships that occur in the student-faculty context require special consideration. These types of intimate relationships can be particularly vulnerable to exploitation and compromise an individual’s ability to make voluntary choices due to the difference in power and the respect and trust that are often present between a student and a faculty member. Faculty are prohibited from participating in an intimate relationship with a student. Moreover, any attempt by a faculty member to show a romantic interest in a student may constitute sexual harassment or raise claims of preferential treatment in violation of the University’s Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment and Retaliation. Similarly, a supervisor's display of a romantic or sexual interest in a subordinate may constitute sexual harassment.</p>\n\n<p>D. Retaliation is a separate, serious offense under this policy and will be considered independently from the merits of the underlying allegation. Upon a finding that retaliation has occurred, the actor will be subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination or expulsion from the University.</p>\n\n<p>E. Anyone who knowingly makes a false allegation under this policy will be subject to appropriate action, including disciplinary action up to, and including, termination or expulsion from the University.</p>\n\n<p>F. Any supervisor or manager who receives notice of an intimate relationship under this policy must immediately report the relationship to Human Resources.</p>\n\n<h4>Reporting</h4>\n\n<p>Reports of violations of this policy should be made to Michael Silvestro, Associate Vice President for Human Resources at (973) 761-9138 or <a href=\"mailto:michael.silvestro1@shu.edu\" id=\"mailto:michael.silvestro1@shu.edu|\">michael.silvestro1@shu.edu</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Responsive Action</h4>\n\n<p>A.

Pre-Complaint Resolution Strategies </strong><br />\nIndividuals may elect, but are not required, to bring their concerns to the person allegedly responsible for the behavior or action. In some matters, self-corrective measures may be taken when those persons who are alleged to have engaged in the behavior or action become aware of how their actions or behaviors are being received. The matter may be concluded by mutual consent at this point. However, the University recognizes that such a strategy may be inappropriate or ill-advised in some circumstances, including in matters that involve sexual misconduct. At all times, individuals have the option to file a complaint alleging violations by faculty, administrators, or staff with the Director of EEO Compliance, Title IX Coordinator (Director) which will be reviewed in accordance with these Guidelines. Complaints involving allegations of violations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy by faculty, administrators, or staff should be brought to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator. In the case of allegations of violations by students, <a href=\"http://www.shu.edu/policies/policy-against-sexual-misconduct-sexual-harassment-and-retaliation.cfm#reporting\" id=\"http://www.shu.edu/policies/policy-against-sexual-misconduct-sexual-harassment-and-retaliation.cfm#reporting|\">complaints should be brought to the attention of the appropriate Deputy Title IX Coordinator</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>II. Purpose </strong><br />\nThe purpose of these Guidelines is to set forth the general procedures that the University may follow when responding to complaints of policy violations by faculty, administrators, or staff involving unlawful discrimination or harassment and/or retaliation under the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy, Anti-Discrimination Policy, or the CEPA Policy. These Guidelines do not replace, abridge or supersede the Student Code of Conduct. These Guidelines are meant to describe generally the University's procedures for responding to complaints and conducting investigations of complaints, where necessary. The University may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, deviate from these Guidelines.  </p>\n\n<p>The President has delegated to the Director the responsibility for assuring the University’s compliance with anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, anti-retaliation and whistleblowing laws and regulations, including the review of complaints and the maintenance of an effective and impartial complaint review process. These Guidelines are under the jurisdiction of the Director and may be updated and revised by the Director, as needed.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>III. Types of Complaints  </strong><br />\nThe types of complaints to which these Guidelines apply include:  </p>\n\n<p>1.)  Allegations of discrimination based upon membership, or the perception of membership, in any legally protected class, including but not limited to the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Age</li>\n\t<li>Handicap and/or Disability</li>\n\t<li>Temporary disability and pregnancy</li>\n\t<li>Race </li>\n\t<li>Color </li>\n\t<li>Creed/Religion</li>\n\t<li>Ethnicity</li>\n\t<li>National Origin, Nationality or Ancestry</li>\n\t<li>Veteran's Status or Military Service</li>\n\t<li>Marital Status (including civil union and/or domestic partnership)</li>\n\t<li>Domestic Violence Victim</li>\n\t<li>Atypical Hereditary Cellular or Blood Trait</li>\n\t<li>AIDS and/or HIV status</li>\n\t<li>Genetic Information </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>2.) Allegations of retaliation for making a complaint, participating in an investigation or otherwise engaging in legally protected activity under the University’s Sexual Misconduct or Anti-Discrimination policies.  </p>\n\n<p>3.)  Allegations of retaliation for making a complaint, participating in an investigation or otherwise engaging in legally protected activity under the University's CEPA Policy. This policy does not apply to the underlying complaint that forms the basis for the alleged retaliation, which will be handled by appropriate University personnel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Retaliation against any individual covered under these Guidelines who has filed a complaint, participates in the review/investigation process or has otherwise exercised any legally protected right is strictly prohibited. Anyone who engages in retaliatory conduct will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including separation from the University.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IV. Procedures for Reviewing Complaints </strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>An individual may file a complaint with his/her supervisor, Human Resources, the Director, or through Ethics Point. Supervisors and Human Resources personnel who receive complaints shall immediately notify the Director. The complaining party is encouraged to put the complaint in writing. A complaint should be made promptly to ensure that an expeditious review can be performed.</li>\n\t<li>The aggrieved person is referred to as the “Complainant” while the person alleged to have engaged in the wrongful conduct is referred to as the &quot;Respondent.&quot;</li>\n\t<li>Within five (5) business days after receipt of the complaint by the Director, the Director will determine, in his/her discretion, whether the complaint falls within the Director’s authority and notify the Complainant.</li>\n\t<li>Within five (5) business days after notification to the Complainant that the complaint falls within the Director’s authority, as described above, the Director, in consultation with appropriate University personnel, will evaluate the complaint and determine whether an investigation and/or other action is necessary. Although consultation with University personnel is called for under these Guidelines, the determination of whether an investigation is necessary remains at all times with the Director.</li>\n\t<li>In the event an investigation is determined to be necessary, the Director may act as the Primary Investigator and, in consultation with appropriate University personnel, will appoint a Co-Investigator. When the complaint involves a student as Complainant, the Co-Investigator may be appointed from the Division of Student Services. The University may, in its sole discretion, elect to retain an external Investigator(s). When an investigation of the complaint is going to be conducted, the Director will notify the Respondent, in writing, of the complaint and describe the general nature of it. The Respondent may provide a written response to the complaint. </li>\n\t<li>The Investigator(s) may, in his/her/their discretion, share documents and/or information gathered in the course of the investigation on a need to know basis.</li>\n\t<li>Truthfulness and cooperation from all participants in the investigation is expected at all times. </li>\n\t<li>Although the Investigator(s) may elect to record witness interviews, investigation participants are prohibited from recording any aspect of the investigation.</li>\n\t<li>In the course of the investigation, the Investigators have the discretion to take any action deemed necessary to conduct a prompt, fair, and impartial, prompt, investigation including, but not limited to, interviewing and/or obtaining written or recorded statements from the Complainant, the Respondent and others and reviewing documents (including electronically stored information).</li>\n\t<li>The Complainant and Respondent may be accompanied by another individual from the University community for the sole purpose of providing support. The support person may not have personal knowledge of or involvement in the matter being reviewed. Respondent’s supervisor may not serve as a support person. </li>\n\t<li>In accordance with the Violence Against Women Act in matters arising under the Sexual Misconduct Policy each party shall be afforded timely notice of meetings and hearings, equal opportunity to participate, the ability to select any support person of one’s choosing, including an individual or attorney from outside the community, equal access to information used during meetings and hearings, and simultaneous notification of determinations, sanctions, and the rationale therefore. </li>\n\t<li>A support person is not permitted to participate in the investigation by, for example, asking or answering questions or interfering with the University's investigation.</li>\n\t<li>Investigations will be completed as promptly as possible and consistent with applicable legal requirements. The time to complete an investigation may vary depending upon the allegations, the number of individuals involved, and the complexity of the issues raised. The Investigators will keep the Complainant and Respondent apprised of the status of the investigation.</li>\n\t<li>In evaluating the evidence and assessing credibility, the Investigators will use a “more likely than not” standard to find facts and determine whether a violation of University policy has occurred. The factual findings of the Investigators are final and are not subject to appeal.</li>\n\t<li>The Investigators will prepare a report, which will be provided to appropriate University personnel. Neither the Complainant, the Respondent nor any participant in the investigation will be entitled to receive a copy of the report, except as otherwise provided herein. </li>\n\t<li>Within ten (10) business days following the completion of the investigation, the Complainant and Respondent will be advised verbally of the findings at separate meetings with appropriate University personnel. A confirming letter may be provided.</li>\n\t<li>After completion of the investigation, a determination will be made by appropriate University personnel (such as the supervisor, division head, HR, and in the case of faculty, under the appropriate Faculty Guide) regarding resolution of the matter and the necessary responsive action, if any. No appeal is permitted. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>V. Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Mediation is encouraged as a first step toward resolution of a complaint. Because each matter is unique, however, mediation may not be appropriate in all situations. For example, complaints alleging sexual assault may not be mediated.</li>\n\t<li>Both the Complainant and the Respondent must agree to mediate the matter before mediation can proceed. The mediation process may commence any time after a complaint is made or during the investigation of a complaint.</li>\n\t<li>The Director and appropriate University personnel must approve the use of mediation and any resolution reached because of mediation.</li>\n\t<li>Mediation should be completed within twenty (20) business days of the agreement to mediate.</li>\n\t<li>The Complainant, Respondent or mediator may terminate the mediation and proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Guidelines. In the event that mediation is not successful, and an investigation follows, the Director may serve as the Investigator notwithstanding his/her role as the mediator. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>VI. Confidentiality and Recordkeeping </strong><br />\nConfidentiality and discretion by those who participate in an investigation are recommended in order to maintain the integrity of the investigation and the privacy of individuals. The University will use its best efforts to treat all complaints and mediations as confidential to the extent possible and in accordance with the law. However, the University does not guarantee confidentiality and information and documents may be shared by the Investigators and/or mediator(s), as necessary, with participants and others. Copies of complaints, mediation agreements and investigation reports will be maintained by the Director. These records are to be maintained and treated as confidential to the extent possible and in accordance with the law. The contents of these records will be discussed or shared on a need to know basis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VII.

Information that is considered directory information may be released without the student's permission, at the discretion of the University, unless the student has specifically submitted a request in writing to the Office of the Registrar requesting that all directory information be kept confidential. If a student requests that all directory information be kept confidential the University cannot release information to anyone, even a prospective employer. This level of confidentiality will remain in place even after the student withdraws or graduates and cannot be removed unless the student submits a request in writing to have it removed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seton Hall's Directory Information</strong><br />\nUnder FERPA, every institution must determine what information will be considered directory information. At Seton Hall, the following information is considered directory information and may be released at the discretion of the University:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>student's name</li>\n\t<li>address (any on file)</li>\n\t<li>telephone listing (any on file)</li>\n\t<li>e-mail address (any on file)</li>\n\t<li>date and place of birth</li>\n\t<li>major field of study</li>\n\t<li>participation in recognized activities and sports</li>\n\t<li>photos or videos</li>\n\t<li>information on height and weight of athletic team members</li>\n\t<li>dates of attendance</li>\n\t<li>degrees and awards received</li>\n\t<li>most recent previous educational institution attended</li>\n\t<li>and high school attended</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All other educational records are not categorized as directory information and cannot be released to anyone but the student without the student's consent on file (with the exception of legitimate school officials and the other exceptions noted below). Students can provide consent to permit specific individuals (parents, guardians) to access to their records by completing the FERPA Authorization.</p>\n\n<p>Students can find the FERPA Authorization Form in PirateNet, within the Academics tab in a channel called 'FERPA.' For each individual to whom a student would like to give FERPA Authorization, the following information must be provided: Full Name, Relationship to the student, Scope of Access, and PIN (4-digit number). The parent/guardian will be required to provide this PIN when calling regarding the student's record; this FERPA Authorization does not grant online access.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is considered a legitimate school official </strong><br />\nThe University can disclose a student's educational records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using University employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.</p>\n\n<p>A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the University.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can the information be released to besides a legitimate school official?</strong><br />\nIn certain instances student information may be released outside of the institution without the student's consent, examples are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>In compliance with any needs resulting from audits, compliance, program reviews or accreditation by any federal or state agency as well as any independent organization or body responsible for related oversight.</li>\n\t<li>To comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena.</li>\n\t<li>To organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the University.</li>\n\t<li>To appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency.</li>\n\t<li>To parents of an eligible student who is claimed as a dependent for income tax purposes. In this case, the parent must provide an IRS Tax transcript each time the parent requests this information if a FERPA authorization for this parent is not on file. The IRS tax transcript must be submitted directly to the office which holds the records in question along with a written request to access the specified student's records. The tax transcript will be required even if the transcript is already on file with the University for financial aid purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What records are considered educational records?</strong><br />\nAny type of record containing information directly relating to a student and maintained by an educational institution, or a party acting on behalf of an institution, qualifies as an educational record.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of an Educational Record include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Biographical information</li>\n\t<li>Grades, test scores and evaluations</li>\n\t<li>Course work including papers and exams</li>\n\t<li>Class schedules or rosters</li>\n\t<li>Disciplinary records</li>\n\t<li>Billing and financial aid records</li>\n\t<li>Admission records</li>\n\t<li>Internship program records</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What type of records are not considered educational records?</strong><br />\nCertain records are not protected under FERPA as such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Faculty, adviser or administrator notes which are used as a memory aid as long as they are not shared with others or put into a student's file. These are considered sole possession records.</li>\n\t<li>Campus Security Records</li>\n\t<li>Records made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional if the records are used only for treatment of a student and made available only to those persons providing the treatment.</li>\n\t<li>Alumni records which contain information about a student after he or she is no longer in attendance at the University and which do not relate to the person as a student.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Authorizing others to access your records </strong><br />\nAs noted above, a student may authorize a parent/guardian or other eligible person to have access to their records or discuss educational records with Seton Hall faculty, staff or administrators. The student should go online to PirateNet to complete the FERPA Authorization Form, located in the Academics tab in a channel labeled 'FERPA.'</p>\n\n<p>The following information must be entered by the student to accord access to his educational records to a parent/guardian/other:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The name of the person and that person's relationship to the student;</li>\n\t<li>The scope of access being granted to the designated person; options include all records, just academic records, just financial records, just billing records, both financial aid and billing records.</li>\n\t<li>A PIN (4-digit number) which the student must provide to the authorized party.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the authorized individual is meeting with a school official in person, he/she can provide a valid form of ID to verify his/her identity or provide the PIN number. If the individual inquiring about a student's records is doing so by phone, he/she will need to provide the PIN number to verify their identity before the information can be released. If the caller does not know the PIN, the student can go online to view the PIN that was entered. The student will then be responsible for providing this PIN to the authorized individual.</p>\n\n<p>Authorization to access records does not entitle the authorized party to obtain copies of records or document, nor does it grant online access to the student's records. . Primarily the purpose of the authorization is to enable the authorized third party to discuss matters pertaining to academic, billing or financial matters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Once a student is no longer enrolled</strong><br />\nIf a student's enrollment at Seton Hall University lapses, either due to withdrawal, graduation, dismissal or any other reason, the information provided on your FERPA Authorization Form is no longer valid. In most cases after enrollment ceases records are only discussed with the former student but the student may authorize his/her representatives to discuss matters on his/her behalf, especially pertaining to payments.</p>","relatedDocument3":"","relatedDocument2":"","relatedDocument1":"","purpose":"<p>FERPA (<a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html\" id=\"http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html|\">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a>) also known as the Buckley Amendment was passed by Congress in 1974.
