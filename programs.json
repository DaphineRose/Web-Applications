Functional analysis, a direct form of functional assessment, is an empirical and reliable tool for assessing function of behavior and developing an appropriate treatment to decrease problem behavior and increase functional skills. Despite the copious amount of literature available on functional analysis, practitioners may be weary of using functional analysis in non-clinical, applied settings, such as schools. This workshop will focus on the utility of functional analysis in a school setting. The workshop will provide a brief review of multi-tier system of supports framework, barriers to conducting functional analysis in school settings, and solutions for overcoming those barriers.
