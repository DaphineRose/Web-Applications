It was during this era and for three decades, when we moved from a single-sex school to a co-educational institution, that the core of modern learning was firmly established and implemented. The role I played was to design what has become the mainstay of the freshman English program at our University. This includes the standard first year College English I and II, the then newly-conceived Basic Skills courses, the support unit of the Writing Center, the advancement of English as a Second Language in the College of Arts and Sciences, and the universal project of Writing Across the Curriculum. During the 1980s, 1990s, and into the new century, I served as director of each of these programs simultaneously, then in turn, as chair of the English Department, and director of Special Projects in the dean's office. Subsequent to these positions, I served as interim-chair of the Department of Criminal Justice, and later and till recently, assistant chair of the English Department. along with these areas of responsibility, I have served on every standing committee in the University.</p>\n","MID_INITIAL":"","BIO":"","URLABSOLUTE":"https://www.shu.edu/profiles/chrysanthygrieco.cfm","IMAGEMEDIUM":"","DEGREES":"","EDUCATION_2":"M.A., Seton Hall University","EDUCATION_1":"Ph.D., Drew University","TAXUNIT":216,"TITLE":"Emeritus Professor of English","HIGHLIGHTED":0,"EDUCATION_5":"","EDUCATION_4":"","EDUCATION_3":"B.A., Montclair State University"},{"YEARSTARTED":"","DEGREE_SUFFIX":"S.T.D.","AREASOFEXPERTISE":"","TAXRELATIONSHIPS":258,"CV_DOCUMENT":"","FIRSTNAME":"Rev.
